Turn your regular pizza into a delightful yet eerie creation with Ghostly Pizza. Start by preparing your favorite pizza dough or using a pre-made crust. Once the pizza is topped with sauce and cheese, it’s time to create the ghostly figures. Take slices of mozzarella cheese and cut them into ghost shapes using a sharp knife or cookie cutter.

Give ordinary hot dogs a spooky makeover with Mummy Hot Dogs. Start by preheating your oven and wrapping each hot dog with strips of pre-made crescent roll dough, leaving a small gap for the eyes. Bake the mummy-wrapped hot dogs until the dough is golden brown and the hot dogs are heated through. Once they’re out of the oven, use mustard or ketchup to add eyes to each mummy.
