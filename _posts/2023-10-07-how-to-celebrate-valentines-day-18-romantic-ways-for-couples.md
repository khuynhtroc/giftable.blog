## Experience Something New And Exciting Together

If you are too bored with [traditional activities on Valentine’s Day](https://avada.io/loveable/things-to-do-on-valentine-day/), you may not want to wait an hour for a reservation in a restaurant or go to places that are all too familiar for couples. Then this is the time for you two to try something new. Spend some time planning a fun and daring adventure with your lover. Find an activity you have always wanted to do and enjoy experiencing together. It could be hiking together, exploring some weird place, or Immersing yourself in nature by visiting a nearby national park. 

## Netflix and Chill

Make some cheesy snacks, prepare popcorn, light a mood-setting candle, crack open a bottle of wine, and snuggle under a blanket in your home to watch a Valentine’s Day movie. But would you like to make it extra memorable? Make a paper heart wreath, an origami bouquet, and a love letter banner to decorate your space.

## Have A Great Night Together At A Fancy Restaurant 

The restaurant’s fancy food and atmosphere will be a special memory for you and your loved one. First, make reservations at a fine dining establishment to celebrate the evening in public.

All in all, a romantic home-cooked meal doesn’t have to be a restaurant’s 5-star standard.

## Make a homemade card tailored for your lover

Instead of buying a ready-made card from the store and she might feel nothing special, you can prepare a [valentine’s card](https://avada.io/loveable/what-to-write-in-valentines-card/) about her. Remember to prepare some good poems and romantic valentine’s quotes to put on the card. Bring your style into the sentence, and she will surely love it.

![Valentine First Date](images/image-8-960x627-1.png "image-8-960x627-1")

Valentine First Date

You put in the most effort to show her your romantic side at the start of your relationship, so why not go back in time and remind her how charming you were when you were wooing her?

Women appreciate it when men recall the minor things from when you two got to know each other. Consider your first date, take her to the same destination, eat the same dishes, and do the same activities that sparked your romance.

## Play Hooky

Take the day off from work and relax—in-bed breakfast, a crossword puzzle, and binge-watching your favorite shows. Recall how and why you and your partner first fell in love. Those sweet memories will heal you both, indeed.

## Craft something together.

Make some homemade Valentine’s Day crafts at home. Consider creating an art project to hang somewhere in the house or making creative picture frames for your favorite photos. You two will have a creative time together.

## Hosting a Valentine’s Day party For your family and friends

Host a Valentine’s Day party to bring your [family](https://avada.io/loveable/valentines-gifts-family/) and friends together. Plan a Valentine’s Day party to give your loved ones a reason to get together during the holiday. Decorate your home with red, pink, and white balloons, streamers, and cutout hearts. Line a table with an assortment of sweets and finger foods, and set the mood with upbeat music. 

Valentine’s day is a holiday that some enjoy. Choose a different theme instead of a Valentine’s Day-themed party to avoid any Valentine’s Day reservations your friends may have. Make the party “Anti-Day” Valentine’s themed, or pick a random theme everyone will enjoy.

## Give your lover a classic gift of flowers and chocolate.

![Valentine Gift](images/image-9-960x628-1.png "image-9-960x628-1")

Valentine Gift

To celebrate Valentine’s Day:

1. Buy a bouquet of your loved one’s favorite flowers, or go with classic red roses.
2. Combine the flowers with a box of chocolates or other confections.
3. Give the gift to your loved one in person or have it delivered to their home as a surprise. 

If you don’t mind spending extra money, pair the flowers and chocolate with a special gift to commemorate the occasion. This could be a nice piece of jewelry, such as a watch or necklace, or something more personal, such as your significant other’s favorite book or video game.

## Bottom line 

The list above includes excellent tips to **celebrate Valentine’s Day**. What a memorable holiday for couples, so do whatever is the minor thing to make the person you love happy.
