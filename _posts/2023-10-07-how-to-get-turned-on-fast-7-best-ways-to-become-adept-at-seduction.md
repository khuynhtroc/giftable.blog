## Not all desires are unpromoted

What do toaster ovens, iPhones, and vibrators all have in common? They are activated by pressing a button. The list doesn’t include your body.

Popular television shows and movies give the impression that quick or impulsive arousal is the norm.

And while it often occurs, particularly at the beginning of relationships, it’s not the only way for good or healthy sex to begin.

When this occurs, the urge for sex is brought on by the deliberate use of sexual, physical, or mental stimulation, such as kissing, massage, reading erotica, or watching pornographic media to set the atmosphere.

Here are some suggestions for deliberately turning yourself on, as well as your spouse, if you have one.

## There must always be enthusiastic consent

According to Alicia Sinclair, CEO of COTR, Inc., the maker of b-Vibe, Le Wand, and The Cowgirl, who is also a certified sex educator, there’s a significant difference between needing a little shove to get in the mood and being pressured by your partner to have the sex you don’t want to have.

She says that it’s crucial to take those indications to stop seriously if one partner is expressing ‘no’ or physically recoiling.

It is not sex to continue when your partner is not passionately in agreement. This is assault.

## How to get turned on: 7 sexy tips and tricks to quickly turn yourself on

### Get an arousal app

There are applications available that can actually help you control your horniness. Enjoy is undoubtedly a fantastic place to start if your search is more along the lines of “I want to learn how to reclaim my sexuality and respect my sexiness” than “I have to get off right TF now.” 

Through individualized, guided journeys, the app aims to teach women what they need to know about arousal, self-esteem, and desires in order to help them reach their sexual peaks. Additionally, there is a part where you may listen to sexual stories, which in a pinch is \*chef’s kiss\*.

### Put on vibrating underwear

Without vibrating panties, where would we be on how to get turned on? The traditional sex object is a fan favorite for a reason, and it’s a great tool to have on hand for situations where arousal isn’t automatic. It recommends wearing a pair and going out to supper with your boo. If you give them the remote, you’ll be hankering for more by the time you leave the restaurant.

Would you prefer to remain in? Try putting them on while cooking supper, watching television, or just relaxing in the evening. No matter where you are, you’ll be shocked by how sexy the unexpected stimulation from your lover may make you feel.

### Watch the sex scene in your favorite movie

One of life’s greatest joys is seeing sex scenes in movies. It’s always a good idea to maintain a list of the sexiest, naked movie sequences ever in your back pocket, whether you’re Netflix-and-chilling with a date or home alone with nothing to do all night but daydream about kissing Kate Winslet. Just be aware that some are so hot-tempered (ahem, Call Me By Your Name) that they can cause the seat of your pants to burn burningly.

_Watch the sex scene in your favorite movie_

You know, sometimes sexual moments in movies are actually superior to porn. Your favorite sensual sequence from the one movie you’ve seen a million times? You are aware of which one! Ready her!

### Take a bath together

When it comes to arousal, unwinding and relaxing are essential, so if fancy baths are your thing, think about taking one before arranging sex time. Grab a luxurious scrub or soak, let the warm water relax your muscles, and physically lean into the faucet. 

Taking some “you time” will help you get in the mood, whether you want to have sex there or wait till you’re somewhere else.

Use a loofah, sponge, washcloth, or even your fingertips to turn yourself on. Your most delicate parts will be much easier for your fingertips to slide over because you are already soapy, moist, and slippery. You don’t even have to masturbate yet (although if you become turned on and can’t resist it, go ahead! ), just concentrate on giving yourself a soft, sensuous touch.

### Active your sense

The practice of sensory sex involves using as many senses as you can to heighten sexual pleasure and foster a greater connection with your partner.

These senses can be visual, aural, or tactile, among many other variations. Sensory sex may help you let go of the pressures that come with exclusively focused attention on the genitalia and can also heighten your desire by focusing on enjoyable feelings throughout your body.

They have a direct bearing on your libido. Azaria Menezes, a relationship and sex counselor, advises the following: Consume some aphrodisiacs (such as chocolate), alter the lighting in your room, turn on some music, switch to silky linens, and spray yourself with a scent that makes you feel hot.

They are great ways how to get turned on and how to get turned on pregnancy.

### Play with your nipples

Before engaging in masturbation or penetrative sex, Kayla Lords, a sexpert for JackandJillAdult.com, advises beginning by concentrating on regions other than your genitals. As she masturbates, she advises caressing your neck, chest, nipples, thighs, and the minor erogenous zones that are disregarded.

Focus on giving yourself a pleasurable touch, and experiment with friction and intensity to find what you enjoy. You could even want to pick up a set of nipple clamps to see if they might help you out a little bit.

### Use some CBD arousal products

According to sexologist Megan Stubbs, certain CBD arousal oils can weaken the integrity of latex barriers like condoms, but if you’re by yourself and just want to get turned on, you don’t need to be concerned about that. 

When utilizing CBD sex products, many people have experienced heightened arousal, wetness, and orgasm intensity. Check out a few for yourself to see if anything changes.
