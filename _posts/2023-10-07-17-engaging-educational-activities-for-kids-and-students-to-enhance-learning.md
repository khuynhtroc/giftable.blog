As parents and educators, we share a common goal of wanting our children to thrive academically and develop a passion for knowledge. One way to achieve this is by incorporating engaging educational activities into their daily routine. From fun games to creative crafts, there are countless ways to make learning exciting for kids and students of all ages. 

In this article, we’ll explore **17 educational activities** that are sure to foster a love for learning in your little ones. And if you’re on the hunt for the best [educational toys for a one-year-old](https://avada.io/loveable/educational-toys-1-year-olds/), be sure to check out the list created by Loveable. Get ready to inspire your children’s curiosity, creativity, and passion for knowledge with these fun and educational activities.

## **17 Educational Activities For Kids And Students**

Here are 17 engaging educational activities that will help your child enhance their learning and cognitive skills while having fun.

### **1\. Jigsaw**

![Jigsaw](images/educational-activities-2.jpg "educational-activities-2")

Jigsaw

One way to encourage accountability among students is to have them teach each other. To do this, create “home groups” consisting of 4 or 5 individuals. Even if everyone is learning remotely, this can be done using Zoom or Google Meet breakout rooms. 

Assign each member of the group a different topic to investigate, and then have them collaborate with students from other groups on the same topic. After mastering the subject matter, they will return to their original group to share their newfound knowledge.

### **2\. One-Minute Paper**

One way to encourage students to reflect on their learning and improve their writing skills is by asking them to share their biggest question or most eye-opening revelation in a minute-long recording at the end of class. 

This activity not only provides insight into their understanding and misunderstandings but also allows them to express their thoughts. Additionally, there are various prompts available that can be used to prompt students to write.

### **3\. Sidewalk Chalk Letters**

![Sidewalk Chalk Letters](images/educational-activities-3.jpg "educational-activities-3")

Sidewalk Chalk Letters

Encourage simultaneous physical and mental activity by using sidewalk chalk letters. Spell out various sight words by hopping from one letter to another. It’s a great way to engage both the mind and body.

This activity is great for kids of all ages. For younger children, you can start with simple three-letter words such as ‘cat’ or ‘dog’ and then move on to more complex words. Older children can practice spelling out longer words like ‘dinosaur’ or ‘elephant’. You can also challenge them to spell out their name or a favorite phrase. 

It encourages gross motor skill development and helps them become more familiar with the sight words they learn in school. Plus, it’s a fun way to get outside and enjoy the fresh air while learning!

### **4\. Word Memory Game**

A way to practice two skills simultaneously is by playing a Word/Definition Memory Game. This can be done by writing new vocabulary words on one card and corresponding definitions on another. Afterward, the game is played similarly to traditional Memory games. Another option is to use synonyms and antonyms instead. 

### **5\. Funny Math Game**

![Funny Math Game](images/educational-activities-4.jpg "educational-activities-4")

Funny Math Game

Setting up this game is quite easy. All you need to do is write math problems on the top of bottle caps and their solutions inside them. If a student answers a math problem correctly, they can keep the bottle cap. Otherwise, it goes back to the pile. The game ends when all the bottle caps are used up, and the player with the most collected bottle caps is declared the winner.

### **6\. Marshmallow Shapes Games**

You can teach geometry in a fun way by using mini marshmallows and toothpicks or small pretzel rods to construct various shapes. Children can progress from 2D to 3D designs as they become more skilled.

### **7\. Family Flag**

Encourage your children to learn about vexillology, which is the study of flags. Discuss with them the meaning behind the symbols on the flags of various countries. You can also guide them in creating their own flag, using the “Good Flag, Bad Flag” guidelines from the North American Vexillological Association. 

Alternatively, you can collaborate with your family to design a flag for your household. This is among great educational activities that will make your kids feel proud and accomplished, as vexillology is an impressive subject to learn about.

### **8\. Story Map**

![Story Map](images/educational-activities-5.jpg "educational-activities-5")

Story Map

In order for children to become writers, it’s beneficial for them to understand the structure of stories. To achieve this, they can use a story map to break down the components of a book. 

This can be done by creating a map for a familiar tale, such as “Goldilocks and the Three Bears,” or by utilizing it as a framework for their own unique story. It’s important not to leave out any key details when paraphrasing this text.

### **9\. Experiment with color** 

The excitement level increases by adding food coloring to the traditional vinegar and baking soda experiment. Apart from using a baster or eye dropper to produce more “explosions,” children can also observe the outcome when different shades merge. No information is omitted when paraphrasing the original text.

### **10\. Stick Math Game** 

One of the benefits of this task is that children can engage in it without any assistance, at any time they have a spare moment (such as when traveling by car). The task involves inscribing a set of mathematical problems on craft sticks, providing an opportunity for children to practice mental arithmetic. The aim is to see how many sticks they can complete within a specified time frame. You can also use this game to [explore even and odd numbers](https://www.smartick.com/lp/learn-even-and-odd-numbers/) and fractions.

### **11\. Personality Note** 

![Personality Note ](images/educational-activities-6.jpg "educational-activities-6")

Personality Note 

Making a personality note can be an engaging educational activity for kids and students because it allows them to reflect on their own thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. This activity can help them develop self-awareness, an essential skill for personal growth and success.

When students [create a personality note](https://avada.io/loveable/personalized-notepads/), they are encouraged to think about their strengths, weaknesses, values, and goals. They can also consider how their personality traits and habits impact their relationships with others and their ability to achieve their objectives.

### **12\. STEM Challenge**

STEM challenges often involve designing and building something like a bridge, robot, or simple machine. By working on these projects, kids apply what they have learned in science, math, and engineering practically and engagingly. This can help them better understand these subjects and how they relate to the real world.

### **13\. DIY Board Game**

![Board Game](images/educational-activities-7.jpg "educational-activities-7")

Board Game

DIY (Do-It-Yourself) board games are great for kids because they encourage creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills. When kids create their own board games, they get to use their imaginations to come up with new ideas and put their design skills to the test.

Designing a board game requires kids to think about game mechanics, player interactions, and balance. They also have to consider the game’s theme, art, and overall presentation. It’s a [fun indoor game](https://avada.io/loveable/fun-indoor-games/) for your kids.

### **14\. Vocabulary Scavenger Hunt**

A vocabulary scavenger hunt is among fun and engaging educational activity for kids and students because it allows them to explore and discover new words in a hands-on and interactive way. 

This activity is great for enhancing learning because it helps students build their vocabulary, improve their reading and writing skills, and increase their overall knowledge of the language. Students are given a list of words to find and define during a vocabulary scavenger hunt. 

### **15\. Play Pretend**

![Play Pretend](images/educational-activities-8.jpg "educational-activities-8")

Play Pretend

Pretend play involves creating and acting out scenarios or roles that are not based on reality. This can involve playing make-believe, acting out imaginary situations, or taking on different personas. By engaging in pretend play, children can develop their imaginations and creativity, which can help them to come up with unique solutions to problems.

Pretend play also helps children develop social and emotional intelligence by exploring different social roles and relationships.

Semantic maps are indeed a great educational activity for kids and students to enhance learning. It is a visual technique used to organize information and ideas around a central concept or theme. It can be used to help students better understand and remember new vocabulary, concepts, or relationships between ideas.

### **17\. Make a Movie**

Creating a film can be an entertaining and informative undertaking for children as it enables them to unleash their inventiveness, innovativeness, and storytelling abilities while enhancing crucial skills such as teamwork, communication, and critical thinking.

Making a movie requires creating a storyline, characters, and plot, which can help kids improve their storytelling skills. They can also develop their ability to organize and sequence events, which can be useful in various academic subjects.
