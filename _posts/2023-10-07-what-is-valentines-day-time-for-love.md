Valentine’s Day is a day set aside to honor love and devotion – a day when many individuals show their love toward one another. It’s often known that people prepare appointments and secret gifts to [surprise their lovers](https://avada.io/loveable/valentines-day-gifts/). Many couples are expecting this special occasion to enjoy their beloved’s company and surprise presents. But, as history changes, Valentine is no longer just for couples.

Valentine’s has been existing for a long time, and it is witnessed many changes from culture to awareness. But, do you truly understand its meaning and history? **What is Valentine’s Day?** What should we choose as a perfect gift for the lover? In this article, we will answer them and give useful tips to help you win your mate’s heart.

## **What Is Valentine’s Day?**

We have to answer this basic question first to have a general insight, so “What is Valentine’s day?”. Valentine’s Day (English name is Valentine’s Day, Saint Valentine’s Day), known as Valentine’s Day is named after Saint Valentine – one of the first Christian martyrs. 

It is often celebrated on the 14th of Feb. Almost every country has adopted the custom of this love festival. Valentine’s Day is a wonderful day for us to express our love and appreciation for those we care about.

## **The History of Valentine’s Day**

There are several legends about Valentine’s day, which evolved into the mythology we know today. Let’s find out a little bit of information and its formation.

### **1\. The original Valentine’s day**

Valentine’s Day is named after Saint Valentine. Whereas the tale of Valentine’s Day remains a mystery, the most well-known version originates from Rome. Many legends about St Valentine evolved into the mythology we know today.

In the third century, there was a priest named Valentinus who resided in Rome. During this time, Emperor Claudius II (a pagan Catholic) enacted laws prohibiting marriage. He contended that Christians should concentrate on paying homage to Rome. Many brutal battles and unpopular backing forced the Roman Empire to join. Due to the difficulty in recruiting young men for the army at the time, Emperor Claudius II said that Roman men were reluctant to leave their families or lovers, and that marriage simply weakened men.

Many objected to the King’s decision once more, particularly Valentine priests at Rome and St. Marius. Despite this ridiculous rule, the priest surreptitiously performed a marriage for two lovers. Regrettably, he was apprehended and executed. On February 14, 273, Father Valentine was imprisoned and sentenced to death by pulling and stoned. Every year, February 14 has been becoming the day for couples to send love messages. Therefore, St. Valentine is now the patron saint of couples.

According to another narrative, this guy was a bishop of Terni who was murdered for attempting to rescue Christians imprisoned. It claims that before his death, he left a note signed “From your Valentine” to his girlfriend.

### **2\. Valentine’s day development**

The 14th of February was not declared St Valentine’s Day until more than 200 years later. By this time, Rome had converted to Christianity, and the Catholic Church was on a mission to eradicate all lingering paganism.

Valentine’s Day was once only an event in North America and Europe. However, it later became famous in most places throughout the world.

The event was not connected with romantic themes until the 1500s. Chaucer used the term “lover” to designate the romantic figure in poetry and song. Courtly love has been starting from this time to express sincerity.

The first commercial cards were created in the late 1700s. From here, this anniversary of love is progressively expanding its influence globally.

### **3\. Valentine’s day meaning**

Valentine’s Day has evolved much beyond the significance of a religious rite throughout the years. The event has various variants and forms in different countries based on cultural variety.

The couple’s romance is the most typical type. Valentine’s Day is an occasion for the entire globe to recognize couples’ love, affection amongst couples, and friendships. People show their love for one another on Valentine’s Day by sending heartfelt greetings or significant presents such as letters, bouquets, mostly popular chocolates, and other special items.

Furthermore, other nations express thanks for all the tight partnerships. You can [express your feelings to friends](https://avada.io/loveable/valentines-day-gift-ideas-friends/), coworkers, or family members. Generally, it is a special day of love. 

## **Valentine’s Day Classification**

![Valentine's Day Classification](images/vltd3.jpg "vltd3")

Traditionally, Valentine only has 1 single day on February 14th every year. But there are probably more times than you don’t know. Besides the main time, many variant types of Valentine’s Day have been celebrated to give more extra time for couples’ love expression. Therefore, in addition to February 14 every year, people have organized two more Valentine’s Days on March 14 and April 14. However, how would we distinguish between them? 

### **1\. Red Valentine**

As we all know, the most popular Valentine’s day we recognize is also known as Red Valentine. Celebrate on the Feb of 14th annually, This is a chance for people to demonstrate for the other half by giving presents and making nice wishes. Especially, Red Valentine is believed to [express love for boys from girls](https://avada.io/loveable/valentine-gift-boyfriend/). Therefore, the lovers who need to prepare gifts on that day are often girls. 

### **2\. White Valentine**

In actuality, [White Valentine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Day#:~:text=White%20Day%20is%20celebrated%20annually,Asian%20nations%20and%20countries%20worldwide.) is celebrated on March 14th annually, one month following Red Valentine’s Day. White Valentine is a tradition that originated in Japan. According to legend, on Red Valentine’s Day in 1965, a lad selling marshmallows offered his lover a giant, pristine white [candy box](https://avada.io/loveable/valentines-day-candy-ideas/) in exchange for her love.

It was quickly embraced by young people to expect for that day. Different from Red Valentines – The day boys receive love messages from girls. Our girls also hope to get responses from their boys, so this day was born. The males will reciprocate the sincerity of the female with meaningful gifts or heartfelt words. Therefore, it is largely expected by the girls falling in love to look for a special surprise.

### **3\. Black Valentine**

This occasion is maybe quite strange because of rarely mentioned, so what is Valentine’s day in black? Black is a pretty dark color that often represents bad luck and failure. Is it right? The answer is no.

Black Valentine originated in Korea on April 14. Black Valentine, as opposed to Red and White Valentine, is a day dedicated to members of the Single Society (FA). During this time, lonely young people in the Korean homeland will invite one another to eat black noodles to enjoy each other’s company. Therefore, even if you are single, it will be a day to celebrate. 

## **Why Do People Give Gifts on Valentine’s Day?**

Who is not happy when getting presents? No one for sure. Giving has been an important part of special occasions, including Valentine’s Day. How do you feel when your lover gives you a secret gift? Your answer is also the feeling of the one who receives a surprise from you.

Remember that you are the best gift from God to your partner. Therefore, the value of presents doesn’t come from themself, it’s just a way to express love. The most important thing is your deep heart to convince others. 

### **3\. Enhance Romantic Feelings**

A present shouldn’t lack on an important date. It’s optional, but it’s really disappointing if you don’t have it. A date in a luxurious restaurant, but you and your partner find it hard to start a conversation because of shyness. A beautiful bouquet will eliminate the awkward atmosphere and bring a romantic feeling for both. 

It’s also useful in case you cannot make an appointment with that person. A gift is to replace an apology for the absence and remind the partner of your love.

On the other hand, it shows good preparation and how you respect this love. Who are not happy about this romance?
