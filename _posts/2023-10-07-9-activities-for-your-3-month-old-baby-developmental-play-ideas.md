A baby’s first few months are a time of surprise and exploration as they develop and grow at an astounding rate. This is the perfect moment to introduce easy-to-engage but engaging activities promoting social, cognitive, and physical growth. Additionally, to find activities for 3-month-olds that strengthen your link with your child and promote social interaction with others, we will address their social and emotional development.

You can actively support and enrich your development by including these developmentally appropriate **activities for a 3-month-old** into your daily schedule while taking advantage of priceless opportunities for play and interaction. Let’s start this fascinating exploration together and see how your baby does! In this article, we’ll look at a selection of age-appropriate play suggestions made with your 3-month-old baby’s entertainment in mind. In addition to being enjoyable, these activities are crucial for developing their newly acquired skills and setting the groundwork for future growth.

## 9 Developmental Activities for 3-Month-Baby to Help Them Grow Mentally

1. Encourage baby to imitate

A crucial part of your baby’s early development is to encourage them to imitate. Babies discover how to interpret and navigate their surroundings by studying and imitating the activities and behaviors of those around them. You can encourage imitation by setting a good example and acting out simple gestures like hand clapping or waving goodbye. Playing games that require repeated actions, such as peek-a-boo or pat-a-cake, can help promote imitation. 

When your infant makes an attempt to mimic you, respond with enthusiasm and give them praise to help them learn and develop self-confidence. Encouragement of imitation improves their physical and cognitive skills while also fostering a sense of connection and social closeness. Babies learn to engage with others and comprehend the power of communication through imitation, setting the groundwork for later social interactions and language development.

2. Change Positions Often

Your infant needs to be moved around frequently for their overall development and well-being. Positional plagiocephaly, or flattening of the back of the skull, can occur if you regularly lie in the same position. You may assist in preventing this problem and encourage good physical development by routinely switching your baby’s position, such as switching between sleeping on their back, doing tummy time, and being held or carried in various positions. 

As different positions activate various muscles and offer various viewpoints of the environment, they also enable a variety of sensory experiences. Babies who change positions frequently learn to transfer their weight, roll over, and eventually sit up and crawl. This promotes the development of motor skills. Each position should be secure and supervised while also providing opportunities for exploration and movement, eventually promoting your child’s physical, mental, and development.

3. Tummy Time

An excellent method to engage your baby and foster development is to place her on her tummy with a few brightly colored toys in front of her. Placing some of the [educational toys](https://avada.io/loveable/educational-toys-1-year-olds/) just out of her reach will entice her to use her developing motor skills and encourage her to reach for the toys. She will hone her hand-eye coordination and build muscle strength as she tries to reach and grab the toys. You foster an atmosphere that is uplifting and supportive by lying in front of her while grinning. 

This not only promotes her physical growth but also strengthens your relationship with her. She begins remembering familiar people as she lifts her head to meet your gaze and makes social and emotional connections. Your baby will have a multifaceted experience thanks to this straightforward activity, which encourages her social, cognitive, and physical growth while also fostering lovely interactions.

4. Talk and Sing

It’s a great method to advance your baby’s language development to describe things to her in words. Summarize what she is experiencing and observing while the two of you play and explore together. You help her develop connections between objects and their properties by giving her vocal descriptions of the surroundings in addition to helping her vocabulary grow. 

These verbal cues aid her cognitive growth and enable her to comprehend and analyze her surroundings. As they are still developing their language skills, exposing infants to a rich linguistic environment is crucial. It’s equally important to offer enough time for rest and silence so that their minds can properly process and assimilate the knowledge they’ve just received. Maintaining a balance between verbal stimulation and quiet time promotes a baby’s overall well-being and healthy cognitive development.

5. Practice Tracking Toys and People

Lay your infant down and roll a ball gently in front of her to help develop his or her visual tracking abilities. Encourage her to keep her eyes on the moving ball. Her visual synchronization and tracking skills are improved by this straightforward yet useful activity. You may add different toys or even individuals to the scene to give her new things to focus on. You provide her with new stimuli to watch and follow by introducing other things and people.

Her attention can be drawn to the action and made more interesting by the auditory stimulus. Be sure to provide a secure environment. Remember to set up a secure setting for this playtime, making sure there is room for her to roam freely. You are actively developing her intellectual and sensory development while encouraging a sense of curiosity and discovery by including these engaging and visually appealing experiences in her playtime.

6. Sing lullabies and Nursery Rhymes

The development and emotional health of your 3-month-old infant might be significantly impacted by you singing lullabies and nursery rhymes to them. Lullabies’ calming and melodic qualities aid in the creation of a quiet and nurturing environment, making it simpler for your infant to unwind and fall asleep. Nursery rhymes’ repeating beats and soothing melodies boost children’s aural senses and may even help them learn a language. 

Your kid will start to understand the tone and rhythm of your voice as you sing to them, deepening your bond. Singing lullabies and nursery rhymes to your baby during naptime, bedtime, or just a peaceful moment together may be calming and comforting for both of you while encouraging an early love of music and language.

7. Mirror On The Wall

Who would have thought that something so straightforward could be so captivating to children? Their young minds are mesmerized by the mystery of faces, including their own reflection. They are unaware they are looking at their own image, but their curiosity sparks a world of wonder and joy. Give them an unbreakable mirror, and get ready to see the most unadulterated joy play out right before your eyes. Their eyes enlarge as they catch sight of their reflection, and a sweet grin starts to form on their small lips.

A symphony of laughing fills the room as this sight warms hearts. This new playmate, an endless source of fun and self-admiration, is welcomed by their naive souls. The mirror becomes closer to them with each passing second, sharing their secrets and giving them a glimpse into a world that is uniquely their own. The happiness discovered in that indestructible mirror paints a picture of unending fascination.

8. Touching Different Textures

Young children’s development journey includes engaging with a variety of textures in crucial ways. It turns tummy time into a way for children to participate actively, making it a more engaging activity. You can gather a variety of textures and adhere them on a solid piece of cardboard to make a dynamic busy board. 

To avoid the possibility of the infant placing any of the materials in their mouth, it is essential to make sure everything is tightly fastened. A world of exploration and discovery is fostered for their developing minds by this sensory journey through touch, which not only enthralls their senses but also fosters the development of their cognitive and motor skills.

9. Riding A Bicycle Movement 

Even in its most basic form, the exercise of riding a bicycle gives young children a way to extend their limbs and increase blood flow. Although they might not be ready for a real bicycle just yet, simulating the pedaling motion can be fun and useful. You can gently cycle your baby’s legs while supporting their back and setting their feet on a comfortable surface. Their muscles stretch as their legs swing back and forth, increasing flexibility and enhancing circulation. 

Their coordination and balance are also stimulated by this rhythmic activity, setting the foundation for upcoming physical milestones. You can’t help but smile along with them as they participate in this imaginary ride since their happiness is contagious. So encouraging mobility in this way paves the way for lifelong enjoyment of physical play and frees their spirits to explore the world around them.
