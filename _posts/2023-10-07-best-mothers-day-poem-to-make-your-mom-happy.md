### “God Created Mothers” Holly Giffers

A mother is a magnificent God-given gift with the ability to solve all of your troubles. It’s true what someone said about how God couldn’t be everywhere, which is why he made a mother.

She is a priceless gift from God, and we can’t [express how grateful we are](https://avada.io/loveable/thank-you-gifts-women/) to have her in our lives. She is the one who fully takes responsibility for doing all necessary to [raise her children](https://avada.io/loveable/different-parenting-styles/) with the utmost selflessness.

All of us love our mothers. Nonetheless, we frequently forget to tell our moms how much we appreciate them. Let’s alter it by embracing the lovely language of poetry.

It’s really a simple love letter to mum. If you don’t tell your mother I Love You frequently, teach your child this poem so that you may both say it to her at the same time.

### “My Heart” by Sharlynn N. Manning

Even if the infant is unaware of it, the first word it learns when it begins to talk is ‘ma,’ meaning mother. The mother is the alpha who will always be there for her child till the end of time. She is a priceless treasure placed upon us by God, and words fail us as we wonder at our good fortune to have her around.

If you have a special place in your heart for your mother, this tempting mom poem can help you express your feelings beautifully.

### “Wonderful Mother” by Pat O’Reilly

Every year, on the second Sunday in May, people of all ages express and reciprocate their love and thanks for their great mothers in recognition of their love, care, selflessness, and sacrifices. This holiday is known as Mother’s Day. 

Many choose to express themselves via poetry, which enables them to do so more effectively. A poem like this is called “Wonderful Mother,” in which the poet praises his mother and compares her beauty to the sun and the sky.

### “Mother” by Lola Ridge

A mother’s love is like moonlight in this brief poem, “turning harsh things to beauty.” This perfectly captures how many people feel about the strength of a mother’s love without descending into the romanticism so frequently seen in poetry on the subject.

Ridge focuses on imagery of reflection in the opening stanza, using the moon, the mirror, and the gleaming stream. She sees a mother as someone who provides an ethereal beauty to the children’s vision of themselves, not only reflecting it back but enhancing it.

### “To My Mother” by Christina Rossetti

The poem is about a mother-daughter relationship’s unending love. Rossetti expresses to her mother all of her heartfelt wishes for her health. She also addresses her mother to accept the flowers she has given her mother, as well as the poetry she has written to her.

This is an emotive poem by a well-known English poet from the 1980s. She brilliantly described how she prayed for her mother and felt privileged to obtain her mother’s happiness. You should teach this poem to your newborn daughter if you have one.

### “Rock Me to Sleep” by Elizabeth Akers Allen

Rock Me to Sleep will send you back to your childhood when your mother used to sing you lullabies and rock you to sleep. This mother’s poetry conveys a great message about how a mother may accept the harshness of the world in order to shield her kid from everything. You can sing this poetry to your youngster while recalling happy childhood experiences.

![The poem is about a mother-daughter relationship's unending love](images/mother-day-poems-2.jpg "mother-day-poems-2")

Her touches have certain distinct properties that only her soul can perceive. This experience cannot be shared with anybody else. Everyone has a romanticized vision of the mother in their hearts. And now, Allen shows the reader this image.

### “A Mother” by Christy Ann Martine

It’s a lovely work that depicts how a mother nourishes and loves her child until the time comes to let the infant soar. If you have a mother, you are unquestionably blessed, and you should do nothing extraordinary to show her that she is the most precious of all the treasures you have.

### “Mother O’ Mine” by Rudyard Kipling

The poem “Mother o’ Mine” appeared in Kipling’s 1892 book The Light That Failed as a dedication. It’s song-like, like many of Kipling’s best works, and lends itself to being read or even sung or chanted loudly. It’s a good poem about a poet honoring his mother, too.

In “Mother o’ Mine,” Kipling honors the reality that mothers love their children without conditions. Kipling understands that his mother would pray for his salvation if he were to commit a sin so awful that he was doomed in body and soul. Kipling also knows that his mother would still love him even if he were executed for some crime or mistake, drowned, or experienced some other tragic catastrophe.

### “Only One Mother” by George Cooper

George Cooper’s poem “Only One Mother” aims to make us aware that while there are many things in this world, such as stars, shells, birds, and lambs, we only have one mother, who is the most priceless gift on earth for a kid. 

He reminds us how fortunate we are to have a mother whose love is unmatched because she loves her kid without conditions and without seeking anything in return. The poet emphasizes the value of mothers in children’s lives and how fortunate we are to have them.

### “Tribute to Mother” by John Greenleaf Whittier

![“Tribute to Mother” by John Greenleaf Whittier](images/mother-day-poems-10.jpg "mother-day-poems-10")

“Tribute to Mother” by John Greenleaf Whittier

‘Tribute to Mother’ is a short poem by American Quaker poet John Greenleaf Whittier (1807-92) in which he remembers sitting at his mother’s knee as a tiny kid. The poet’s mother curbed his ‘selfish moods’ and taught him a ‘chastening love’.

This is a beautiful poetic homage to your mum. You can sing this poem with your child to honor all the wonderful mothers.

### “To My Mother” by Edgar Allan Poe

These verses for Mother’s Day may not be one of the poet’s most well-known. Yet, it remains Poe’s most heartfelt and emotional poem. He wrote this nice poem for her mother-in-law to honor all the sacrifices she has through while raising his darling wife.

‘To My Mother,’ which was released in July 1849, features several stunning images. When employed appropriately, imagery helps a poet to engage the senses of the reader. Poe does this in this poem by referring to the “burning phrases of love” and claiming, quite effectively and evocatively, that he can hear angels talking.
