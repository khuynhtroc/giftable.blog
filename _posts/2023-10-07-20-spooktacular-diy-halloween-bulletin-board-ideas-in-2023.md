### **15\. Autumn Bulletin Board Idea Falling for All Things Fall** 

![Halloween Bulletin Board](images/screenshot_14-6.jpg "screenshot_14-6")

At McKinley Early Childhood, the toddler teachers understand the value of involving their little ones in the decoration process. They have come up with a delightful and engaging fall bulletin board idea that incorporates adorable hand-print leaves. This simple yet creative bulletin board serves as a perfect backdrop for the entire fall season. With the addition of pumpkins, scarecrows, corn stalks, and other fun fall items, the possibilities for decorating are endless. Let’s explore this toddler-friendly fall bulletin board idea in more detail!

**To-Do**

- The Tree: Trace or draw a tree shape on brown paper and position it on the left side of the board, with branches pointing right.
- The Leaves: Print or trace leaf templates onto colored cardstock. Optionally, have children dip their hands in paint and press them onto the leaf cutouts. Place the leaves on the tree branches, cascading down towards the bottom of the board.

### **16\. Arts Bulletin Board Idea Creepy Contractions Halloween Language** 

![Halloween Bulletin Board](images/screenshot_15-6.jpg "screenshot_15-6")

Betsy McKnight, a fourth-grade teacher and contributor to Izzyshare, faced an interesting challenge when her unit on contractions coincided with the week of Halloween. Instead of keeping these two themes separate, she decided to creatively merge them, inventing an engaging concept called “Creepy Contractions.”

**Creepy Contraction Activities:**

You have two options for this activity: use a pre-designed haunted house coloring page or let students design their own houses using construction paper. Ensure the house design has plenty of windows.

Students should color or decorate their creations and cut them out. Carefully create window flaps with scissors, then mount the cutout on colored construction paper (black, orange, or yellow). While the glue dries, have students brainstorm common contractions and their original words.

Afterward, students can write the contractions on the front of the house windows and open the flaps to write the original words underneath. These decorations serve as both festive classroom decor and useful study aid.

### **17\. We’re Batty Over Halloween! – Halloween Bat-Themed Bulletin Board Idea**

![Halloween Bulletin Board](images/screenshot_17-6.jpg "screenshot_17-6")

Kim White, a preschool teacher and contributor to the teacher resource site Gigglepotz has designed a delightful holiday bulletin board to showcase her [students’ Halloween crafts](https://avada.io/loveable/blog/easy-halloween-craft-ideas/). This fun and festive bulletin board idea is not only super simple to create but also serves as a wonderful source of inspiration for future Halloween displays. 

**Decoration:**

1. The Bats

For the decoration, utilize the creations made by your students! Display their handmade bats on the bulletin board to bring a personalized touch to the design.

2. The Other Details

To enhance the theme of “bats in the night sky,” Kim White, the creator of this bulletin board, added a yellow moon. You can follow suit by incorporating a yellow moon as well. For added excitement, consider creating wispy white clouds to give a spooky ambiance. Additionally, you can create an illusion that the bats are flying out of a haunted chimney or attic window, adding an extra element of intrigue to the overall design. 

### **18\. Halloween Math Bulletin Board Idea Trick or Treat On Odd and Even Street!** 

![Halloween Bulletin Board](images/screenshot_16-5.jpg "screenshot_16-5")

Although this bulletin board idea, originally submitted to Teaching Photos, was not intended as a Halloween display, we believe it can be easily adapted to serve as a fantastic addition to your holiday decor. By making a few tweaks, you can transform it into an interactive math review activity for your students while also creating a festive display to enjoy throughout the month of October.

**Decoration:** 

- Even Street Houses: Paint the houses on “Even Street” orange and accentuate them with purple roofs, lime green doors, and gray windows, creating a captivating Halloween theme.

- Odd Street Houses: Utilize Halloween-themed or printed scrapbook paper to construct the houses on “Odd Street.” Enhance the houses by incorporating cutouts of ghosts, ghouls, and other eerie figures from windows and doors.

- House Numbers: Create house numbers using a ‘spooky’ Halloween font like Wild Wood, adding a touch of charisma and charm to the bulletin board.

**Decoration:**
