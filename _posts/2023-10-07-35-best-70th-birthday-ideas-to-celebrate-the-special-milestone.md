![Back to the 1970s](images/back-to-the-1970s.jpg "back-to-the-1970s")

Your 70-year-old grandparent likely has fond memories of the 1970s, back to the time when they were a young lady/man! They’ll enjoy a trip down memory lane to a decade known for its wild fashion and incredible music scene.

Wear the ’70s spirit with bell-bottom jeans, wide-collar shirts, peasant blouses, and disco dresses. Don’t forget to serve popular cocktails, mini quiche Lorraines, and cocktail sausages. To top it off, hiring a ’70s disco and funk band will ensure your themed party is a hit!

Select a cuisine from around the world that the 70th birthday lady or man absolutely loves, whether it’s Chinese, Italian, or Spanish, and prepare a delightful feast featuring traditional dishes from that culture.

The dishes you whip up could be their personal favorites from their global adventures or even a nod to their place of birth and upbringing. The goal is to enjoy a culinary journey, relish delectable flavors, and take your taste buds on an exotic voyage.

### **3\. Wonderful Destination Party**

You’re all gathered here to celebrate your loved one’s 70th birthday, but who knows them the best? With the birthday person’s help, you can become the quizmaster and create a quiz about their life, experiences, likes, and more.

Some questions can be simple, like their zodiac sign or their kids’ and grandkids’ names and birthdays. Others can be a bit more specific, like their favorite teacher from school or something that really annoys them. After you’ve checked the answers together, the birthday person can announce the quiz winner. 

### **5\. Birthday Photo Booth**

### **8\. Eat Out at a New Restaurant**

From donning party hats to classic games like pin the tail on the donkey, enjoying jelly and ice cream, or even trying to make balloon animals – no rule says 70th birthday celebrations can’t be a bit playful.

As people approach their 60s and 70s, nostalgia for their childhood often grows. That’s why a 70th birthday is a wonderful chance to embrace that nostalgia and throw a party the younger version of your loved one would have adored.

### **13\. Charity Fundraiser**

Spread out a blanket, unpack your favorite snacks, sandwiches, and refreshing drinks, and enjoy a leisurely feast while enjoying the beautiful ocean views. Whether you’re with family or friends, a beach picnic is a delightful experience.

### **16\. Join Mixology Classes**

### **19\. Karaoke Night**

### **21\. Make 70th Birthday Cake** 

![Make 70th Birthday Cake ](images/make-70th-birthday-cake.jpg "make-70th-birthday-cake")

While lighting seventy candles might pose a fire hazard, you can still celebrate their milestone age by baking (or ordering) a cake in the shape of the number 70. Not only will this unique cake make for stunning photos, but a larger cake also ensures there’s enough to go around for all the guests on your loved one’s extensive party list to enjoy a slice.

### **22\. Make a Birthday Video**

![Make a Birthday Video](images/birthday-video.jpg "birthday-video")

Invite your family and friends to capture brief video messages sharing their cherished memories of your dad. Later, play these heartfelt messages on a large screen after the cake-cutting ceremony for a touching surprise. Alternatively, consider arranging a live video call where everyone can collectively wish your dad a happy occasion.

### **23\. Memory Scrapbook**

![Memory Scrapbook](images/memory-sharing-time.jpg "memory-sharing-time")

Craft a meaningful scrapbook comprising 70 pages, each summarizing significant moments from each of your dad’s seven decades of life.

Consider gifting a potted plant or a beautiful bouquet of her favorite flowers; she’ll surely appreciate these excellent gift ideas. If she takes pride in her garden or it could use a little sprucing up, consider hiring a gardener to add some fresh blooms and rejuvenate her garden space.

### **26\. Set up Vintage Theme**

![Set Up Vintage Theme](images/vintage-theme.jpg "vintage-theme")

One good decoration idea is to take a trip down memory lane with a fun vintage-themed party.

And be sure to serve up some classic dishes and drinks to remind the birthday person of their younger years. It’s a great way to celebrate and reminisce together!

### **27\. Photos Through the Years SlideShow** 

![Photos Through The Years SlideShow](images/photos-through-the-years-slideshow.jpg "photos-through-the-years-slideshow")

Make a special timeline wall with pictures from throughout the years, and hang them up using lighted clips. Add interesting facts about the person being celebrated right next to the photos to make it even more fun. You can hang these on helium balloons for a floating effect, or place them along the entrance path on the lawn. Include important moments like graduations, weddings, the arrival of children, and more. 

### **28\. Family Reunion**

### **29\. Have a Bingo Night**

![Have A Bingo Night](images/have-a-bingo-night.jpg "have-a-bingo-night")

Make bingo cards and print them with the guest of honor’s name. Write their name and numbers from 1 to 90 on the cards.

Classic games like these can be played at any birthday party, including a 70th birthday celebration.

### **30\. Host a Pool Party**

### **31\. Tea Party**
