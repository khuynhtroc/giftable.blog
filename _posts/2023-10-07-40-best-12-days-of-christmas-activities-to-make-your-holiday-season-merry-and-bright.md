Over 12 days leading up to Christmas, families, and friends come together to engage in various delightful and memorable activities. From decorating gingerbread houses to singing carols, each day is filled with laughter, love, and cherished moments.

This blog will guide you through creative and heartwarming ideas for celebrating Christmas activities in 12 days to make this holiday season special.

## **12 Days of Christmas Activities for Adults**

### **1\. Attend a Christmas Parade**

![Attend a Christmas Parade](images/attend-a-christmas-parade.jpg "attend-a-christmas-parade")

There’s nothing more cheerful and festive than a Christmas parade! Watching everyone don their most joyful outfits while floats and holiday characters go by is truly a delightful sight during this season of celebration.

### **2\. [Max Fun Antler Ring Toss](https://www.amazon.com/Max-Fun-Christmas-Inflatable-Reindeer/dp/B07YR3ZZSF)**

![Max Fun Antler Ring Toss](images/max-fun-antler-ring-toss.jpg "max-fun-antler-ring-toss")

This game is a surefire way to leave no one with their dignity untouched. One player is tasked with donning the reindeer headgear, while another takes on the challenge of tossing rings onto the antlers. Ultimately, everyone ends up laughing, shaking with mirth, just like a bowl full of jelly.

### **3\.** [**Naughty or Nice Christmas Edition**](https://www.etsy.com/listing/761207829/adult-christmas-party-game-naughty-or)

![Naughty or Nice Christmas Edition](images/naughty-or-nice-christmas-edition.jpg "naughty-or-nice-christmas-edition")

This printable allows guests to mark off the “nice” and “naughty” deeds they’ve done throughout the holiday season. Whoever checks off the most in each category wins a prize, although the winner of the “naughty” category might humorously receive a lump of coal instead.

### **4\. Holiday Movie Drinking Game**

![Holiday Movie Drinking Game](images/holiday-movie-drinking-game.jpg "holiday-movie-drinking-game")

Select a Christmas film and then pinpoint specific expressions, terms, or behaviors that will serve as cues for everyone to take a drink. If you lack ideas, you can find pre-established drinking games for Hallmark holiday movies and “Elf.” To boost everyone’s enthusiasm for sipping, substitute harsh shots with servings of eggnog, sparkling ginger sangria, or other delightful Christmas-themed cocktails.

### **5\.** [**Ugly Christmas Sweater Contest**](https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/BBA20B90-53BE-4248-B6BE-1E13B6BF5DED) 

![Ugly Christmas Sweater Contest ](images/ugly-christmas-sweater-contest.jpg "ugly-christmas-sweater-contest")

It’s a real classic that everyone loves! Here’s how it works: we all gather in our silliest, most outlandish Christmas sweaters, and the person wearing the absolute wackiest one wins a fantastic prize (maybe even a super cool addition to their Christmas stocking?).

### **6\.** [**Funko Christmas Story Card Game**](https://www.amazon.com/Christmas-Story-Major-Card-Game/dp/B0863FPRTD/)

![Funko Christmas Story Card Game](images/funko-christmas-story-card-game.jpg "funko-christmas-story-card-game")

Hey there! I’ve got this super fun game about those awesome Christmas movies we love. It’s based on Ralphie’s adventure to snag his dream BB gun and that cool decoder ring he’s been eyeing for Christmas.

### **7\.** [**Christmas Movie Bingo**](https://www.etsy.com/listing/583644235/digital-christmas-movie-bingo-card-party)

![KBandFriends Christmas Movie Bingo](images/kbandfriends-christmas-movie-bingo.jpg "kbandfriends-christmas-movie-bingo")

This card features squares with common Christmas movie tropes such as “snowball fights” or “someone wearing a Santa hat.” As you watch Christmas films as a group, the first person to complete five in a row on their Bingo card earns the coveted title of Christmas Movie Champion.

### **8\. Gift Wrap Physical Challenge** 

![Gift Wrap Physical Challenge ](images/gift-wrap-physical-challenge.jpg "gift-wrap-physical-challenge")

Here’s a fun activity that will put family bonds to the test: Divide into teams of two and determine who can wrap a gift neatly and quickly. The catch? Each person must have one arm behind their back, making it a true test of teamwork!

### **9\. The Caroling Challenge**

![The Caroling Challenge](images/the-caroling-challenge.jpg "the-caroling-challenge")

Choose from the classics like “Jingle Bells” or give a more modern holiday hit like Mariah Carey’s “All I Want For Christmas is You” a shot. You might be familiar with the first few lines of these songs, but it becomes quite challenging as you go along!

Pick a song from [Good Housekeeping](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/holidays/christmas-ideas/g2680/christmas-songs/)

### **10\.** [**Christmas Pictionary Cards**](https://www.etsy.com/listing/894891252/christmas-pictionary-cards-holiday-party)

![Christmas Pictionary Cards](images/christmas-pictionary-cards.jpg "christmas-pictionary-cards")

Let’s see how creative you can be in a fun game! It’s called “Draw and Guess Holiday Words.” The rules are simple: you draw your favorite holiday words and phrases, and your team tries to guess them. The more correct guesses your team makes in just 2 minutes, the more points you score. 

## **12 Days Of Christmas Activities For Work**

### **11\. Have a Christmas Photocall**

![Have a Christmas Photocall](images/have-a-christmas-photocall.jpg "have-a-christmas-photocall")

Why not capture the festive spirit at work by arranging a Christmas photocall? To have more excitement, consider turning it into a contest with small incentives to motivate participation. When your colleagues return from the holidays, they’ll be able to see that you all had a fantastic time celebrating together.

### **12\. Merry Murder Mystery**

![Merry Murder Mystery](images/merry-murder-mystery.jpg "merry-murder-mystery")

Murder mysteries are a great choice for small office Christmas parties. Start by choosing a captivating mystery theme like a New Year’s Eve party murder, Santa Claus’s demise, or an ugly sweater party murder. Encourage attendees to dress accordingly or bring relevant props for added immersion. Assign unique roles to everyone and dive into the script. Participants will eagerly listen, hunt for clues, and aim to solve the mystery first.

### **13\. Host a Department Decoration Contest**

![Host a Department Decoration Contest](images/host-a-department-decoration-contest.jpg "host-a-department-decoration-contest")

To make a holiday decoration more energetic, why not turn it into a spirited competition? You should think of organizing a department decoration contest, where each individual has the creative freedom to adorn their cubicle or desk based on their style. 

Foster teamwork by allowing departments to collaborate and decorate their shared spaces together. This friendly competition can infuse the workplace with a festive spirit and showcase the unique creativity of your colleagues.

### **14\. White Elephant Exchange**

![White Elephant Exchange](images/white-elephant-exchange.jpg "white-elephant-exchange")

White Elephant Exchanges are workplace Christmas highlights. Unlike traditional Secret Santa, they feature funny and [novelty gifts](https://avada.io/loveable/funny-novelty-gifts/). What makes it special is the fun of gift theft, adding excitement to the festivities. In this game, participants set an order for the gift exchange. They can either receive a gift from their assigned partner or pick one randomly from the pile. The next player can choose a new gift or steal from the previous one.

### **15\. Hidden Snowmen**

![Hidden Snowmen](images/hidden-snowmen.jpg "hidden-snowmen")

“Hidden Snowmen” is a delightful game that will challenge employees’ observation skills and add a touch of festive fun to your party. You can place these snowmen in creative spots like on platters/buffet tables, among balloons near the entrance, within floral centerpieces, or nestled among presents under the tree. Given that the snowman symbol consists of three circles, it’s a straightforward yet entertaining task to hide them throughout the venue.

### **16\. Holiday Movie Marathon**

![Holiday Movie Marathon](images/holiday-movie-marathon.jpg "holiday-movie-marathon")

Get ready to indulge in your cherished Christmas classics for a joyful time! For an inclusive twist, consider hosting this event virtually and extending an invitation to your remote employees. It’s a fantastic way to ensure everyone can partake in the fun, regardless of their location.

### **17\. Host an Awards Ceremony**

![Host an Awards Ceremony](images/host-an-awards-ceremony.jpg "host-an-awards-ceremony")

Christmas is the season of merriment and gratitude, making it the perfect occasion to host an awards ceremony for your colleagues. It is crucial to recognize and reward colleagues for their unwavering commitment and dedication, even during holiday breaks. It helps to show the company’s genuine appreciation and value for their efforts.

### **18\. Host a Holiday Bake-Off**

![Host A Holiday Bake-Off](images/host-a-holiday-bake-off.jpg "host-a-holiday-bake-off")

Inspire everyone to contribute by bringing their beloved holiday treats and ignite a friendly bake-off competition! The level of complexity is entirely up to you – from playful cookie decorating contests to full-blown Iron Chef-style challenges, complete with a panel of discerning judges. This activity is a delightful way to usher in the festive season with a dash of culinary creativity and a lot of fun!

### **19\. Christmas Karaoke**

![Christmas Karaoke](images/christmas-karaoke.jpg "christmas-karaoke")

The office Christmas party cannot miss the karaoke stage, allowing colleagues to showcase their vibrant, expressive side! While singing with friends and family is enjoyable, singing alongside colleagues can be a challenge. It can become a colossal embarrassment and potentially lead to a transfer to another state after the holiday season.

### **20\. [Host an Ugly Sweater Contest](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Christmas+ugly+sweater&crid=RC6VOIWBQLQW&sprefix=christmas+ugly+sweater+%2Caps%2C366&ref=nb_sb_noss_2)**

## **12 Days of Christmas Family Activities**

### **21\. Decorate the House**

![Decorate the House](images/decorate-the-house.jpg "decorate-the-house")

Engaging children in decorating the house with twinkling lights, stockings, garlands, and a tree creates a magical experience.

### **22\. Take the Family Ice Skating**

![Take The Family Ice Skating](images/take-the-family-ice-skating.jpg "take-the-family-ice-skating")

Ice skating is a cherished Christmas tradition for a good reason. It offers an active, enjoyable experience and allows you to glide gracefully on the ice, even if you reside in a region where snow is a rarity.

### **23\. Read Christmas Book** 

![Read Christmas Book](images/read-christmas-book.jpg "read-christmas-book")

There’s an abundance of wonderful classic holiday books that you can enjoy as a family tradition! Consider reading the same book every year around this time with your little ones. Some of our cherished favorites include “Twas the Night Before Christmas,” “How the Grinch Stole Christmas,” and “The Polar Express.”

### **24\. Make and Send Some Christmas Cards**

![Make and Send Some Christmas Cards](images/make-and-send-some-christmas-cards.jpg "make-and-send-some-christmas-cards")

Another wonderful way to bond with friends and family is by crafting your own Christmas cards. You can dress up and capture a lovely family photo – a thoughtful keepsake for relatives to see how everyone is faring. Alternatively, you can involve your pet in the process and coax them into posing for a photo (with a few treats as incentives, of course!). Alternatively, gather your art supplies and let your creative instincts run wild!

During Christmas, it’s a great time to give back. Sort through your unwanted items and donate them to organizations like The Salvation Army’s Christmas Present Appeal. Support initiatives like “Feeding Families” by donating food items or assembling a hamper for a family in need. These acts of kindness can brighten someone’s holiday season and help families facing financial challenges.

### **26\. Have a Lights Tour**

![Have a Lights Tour](images/have-a-lights-tour.jpg "have-a-lights-tour")

With any luck, by the sixth day of Christmas, your neighbors will have had ample time to decorate their homes with festive lights! To make it an even more memorable experience, consider packing some snacks for the journey and encourage each child to rate the decorated houses on a scale from 1 to 10.

### **27.  Plan a Family Photoshoot** 

![Plan A Family Photoshoot](images/plan-a-family-photoshoot.jpg "plan-a-family-photoshoot")

It’s just like a regular gift exchange, but with a twist – the participants are kids, and the gifts they trade are carefully chosen toys. Need some toy ideas? Check them out here! (Hint: This works better with slightly older kids, as younger ones might not enjoy seeing their presents traded by their friends.)
