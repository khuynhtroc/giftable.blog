You might think that 9 months old is too soon for a newborn to have interactive activities. Don’t misunderstand! As a parent or caregiver of a 9-month-old, you may be looking for new and exciting activities to promote your child’s development and strengthen your bond with them. At this age, babies are curious and eager to explore the world around them, making it an ideal time to introduce them to stimulating and interactive activities. 

The good news is that there are several imaginative and interesting **9-month-old activities** that can aid in their cognitive, physical, and social-emotional development. These activities not only allow your baby to learn and grow, but they also give valuable experiences for you and your kid to enjoy. Incorporating sensory play, music, and movement into your everyday routine may be both enjoyable and useful for your 9-month-old. You just need to make sure your baby is always safe while operating activities. Let’s see what it is!

## **11 Creative and Engaging 9-Month-Old Activities**

### **1\. Phone Talk**

![Phone Talk](images/9-month-old-activities2.jpg "9-month-old-activities2")

Simply place the phone near your baby’s ear and speak to them cheerfully. Tell them about your day, sing a song, or make funny sounds. This exercise can help them improve their listening and communication abilities while also allowing them to bond with you. To protect your baby’s safety, restrict the amount of time he or she spends on the phone.

### **2\. Practice using spoons for eating and practice drinking from an open cup**

Give your baby infant-friendly tools and foods such as Greek yogurt that are easy to scoop for practice. You may also model the habit by sitting at the table with your kid and eating together. Aside from utensils, educating newborns on how to drink from an open cup is critical. Fill a tiny cup with an ounce of water and help your infant bring the cup to their lips. 

### **3\. Tunnel Time**

Make a fun obstacle course for your baby out of a huge cardboard box or a pop-up play tunnel. Crawling through the tunnel will assist your infant in developing gross motor skills and spatial awareness. You may also use the tunnel as a fun hiding place for peek-a-boo games or to encourage your baby to crawl toward you. 

### **4\. Play Music Together**

You don’t have to be a musical genius to enjoy making music with your child; basic instruments such as maracas, bells, and drums are available at most toy stores and may give hours of enjoyment. Encourage your infant to participate by clapping or pounding on an instrument, and remember to dance to the beat!

### **5\. Explore Different Texture** 

Collect a variety of textures, such as a soft blanket, a bouncy ball, a smooth block, and a harsh piece of sandpaper.
