It is summertime, and it is such a regret not to spend time with your most beloved ones and have some family indoor activities in the hot weather. These indoor family activities will not only keep boredom at bay but also foster bonding, laughter, and lasting memories. Outdoor activities are common, but are there any indoor activities that really stand out and are worth doing together for your family?

Look no further! In this article, we have compiled a fantastic list of **50 fun and entertaining indoor family activities** that are sure to delight all ages. Whether you’re seeking creative crafts, engaging games, or immersive experiences, we’ve got you covered with a diverse range of ideas suitable for everyone. So, stay focused and be ready to embark on a thrilling journey with your beloved ones, filled with laughter, learning, and endless entertainment with these indoor family activities!

## 20 Fun and Entertaining Indoor Activities For Family To Do Together

1. **Create a treasure hunt**: Hide items throughout the house and give family members hints to find and gather them. Give your children a list of common household things to find and gather instead of using scavenger hunt-style hints if they are too young to understand them.
2. **Set up a picnic inside:** Having a picnic does not need being outside. Remember to prepare a blanket in the living room, pack a picnic basket with the kids, and eat the food you made. Create a warm campsite in your living room with blankets, pillows, and a fake fire for a night of camping-themed fun without leaving your house.

3. **Board Game Extravaganza**: Bring out various [board games](https://avada.io/loveable/gifts-board-game-lovers/) to enjoy friendly competition and strategic thinking as a family. Far more modern board games are excellent for kids than classics.
4. **Hold a Dance Party**: Turn up the music, have a family dance party, show off your best moves, and make happy memories. You can allow every single member of your family to turn on their personal playlist one at a time.
5. **Make a puppet show**: Create your handcrafted figures or sock puppets to perform an exciting puppet performance promoting storytelling and imaginative play. Puppets can be made from stuffed animals, socks, and cut-out forms on popsicle sticks, and a stage can be made from the back of a couch or a table covered in fabric.
6. **Tell stories**: With a nice, old-fashioned storytime, you will never go wrong. If your children are mature enough, they can totally alternate reading. Select a topic that appeals to every family member for the best experience.

7. **Examine the ancient toys**. In the end, your playroom will be a lot better organized, and you might even find some old toys that you can donate or store. Your cousins and siblings could participate in this activity so you can play together everywhere.
8. **Visit a library:** The neighborhood library is the best option to get everyone out of the house for no cost. One of the simplest family activities at home is also one of the most beneficial. Reading together as a family to increase knowledge is never a dull concept.
9. **Cook cookies**: Put on your aprons and enlist the assistance of the kids for mixing, rolling out the dough, and decorating. Family members are welcome to participate in this fun activity and lend a hand. But ensure the younger children are safe in the kitchen when doing this activity.
10. **Make a pizza together**: For younger children, cookies are delightful and simple, but we suggest that more challenging baking or cooking projects might be enjoyable for elementary or middle-school-aged children. It is simple to roll out the dough, spread the sauce, and arrange the toppings on a pizza, making it a fun food.
11. **Try some mindfulness exercises**: You can get your children to reflect on their week by getting them involved in some of the greatest mindfulness activities. Kids can benefit greatly from this by learning how to manage their time well and create a daily schedule on their own without aid from others.

12. **Go to a museum**: This is not only an educational but also a fun approach to pass some time during a downpour to visit a children’s museum that offers interactive and interesting activities. Check to see whether your neighborhood library offers discounts on tickets before you purchase them.
13. **Family Movie Marathon**: Settle in for a movie marathon with a selection of family-friendly films, complete with popcorn and cozy blankets. Some things you have to do to bring out the blankets are, pop some popcorn, and snuggle in to watch a recent release or an old classic.
14. **Play Global**: This online geography-based quiz game allows kids to hone and expand their worldwide geographic knowledge. The goal is to identify the mystery nation by making educated guesses about the names of nearby nations. You may engage in it once daily or as frequently as you’d like by using the practice mode feature. 
15. **Solve these riddles**: Riddles are a fun way to kill time and help kids to think creatively. The ones that make students use their arithmetic abilities the most are their favorites. But remember that this is only a family game, so do not pressure your child; just enjoy it together.

16. **Pretend to be in class**: Allowing your child to be the instructor and you to be the student adds a delightful twist. You will find that of all the games mentioned above; this one is the most fascinating because other family members can take on various responsibilities in the school.
17. **Play a role**. An entertaining play would be to act out an existing picture book. Or your eldest relative, if they have one, might have a story of their own, based on how old they are. For the final performance, costumes are required to ensure your family has the best possible time.
18. **Create a city out of masking tape**: Create paths and structures on the floor using masking tape (this works especially well in carpeting rooms because the tape will peel off extremely quickly). After that, you can get some toy vehicles and then have fun.
19. **Make cards for greetings**: Kids can cut pictures and text from magazines to place on the outside of their cards while writing on the inside as a writing exercise and arts and crafts project. Alternatively, they can get their crayons out and create a hand-crafted card.
20. **Create a dance together**: If someone in your family is very skilled at coordinating movement, try creating a dance together. The entire family can learn a popular dance’s choreography online, and they can perform it in front of the family or record it on their phones.
