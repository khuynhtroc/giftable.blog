## **30 Must-Try Christmas Cookies Recipes**

### **Spritz Cookies**

![christmas cookies recipe](images/christmas-cookies-recipe-1.jpg "christmas-cookies-recipe-1")

Derived from the German term “spritzen,” signifying “to squirt,” these luscious cookies bear this moniker due to the utilization of a cookie press that imparts their distinctive contours. Spanning from snowflake motifs to charming Christmas trees, spritz cookies manifest in myriad merry designs.

### Christmas Tree Cookies

![christmas cookies recipe](images/christmas-cookies-recipe-2.jpg "christmas-cookies-recipe-2")

Christmas would be incomplete without cookies, and this season, we kick off the festivities with these tree-shaped treats adorned using an incredibly easy marbling method that’s truly worthy of a TikTok trend.

This technique is ideal for engaging children or for applying to various other holiday cookie forms. Imagine candy canes featuring a charming red and white marble effect, or snowflake figures crafted in a serene blue and white design. The creative opportunities are boundless!

### **Panettone Cookies**

![christmas cookies recipe](images/christmas-cookies-recipe-3.jpg "christmas-cookies-recipe-3")

The notion that a soft, enriched bread could metamorphose into a delectable, buttery cookie might appear implausible at first glance. However, we encourage you to continue perusing! These cookies serve as an impeccable foundation for incorporating cherished elements like orange peel, currants, dried apricots, chocolate, and almonds, reminiscent of the original Christmas cookies recipe, all achieved with just half the effort.

### **Snowball Cookies**

![christmas cookies recipe](images/christmas-cookies-recipe-4.jpg "christmas-cookies-recipe-4")

A gentle heads-up: the snowy and delightful factor of these snowballs comes from the powdered confectioner’s sugar, which has the potential to create a sugary sprinkle with each mouthful. It’s wise to have napkins on standby and enjoy them over a plate to capture the wintery ambiance.

### **Gingerbread Cookies**

![christmas cookies recipe](images/christmas-cookies-recipe-5.jpg "christmas-cookies-recipe-5")

Gingerbread requires a generous portion of ground ginger, a small quantity of cinnamon, and a minimal dash of cloves. This combination creates the ideal formula for a delightful Christmas treat. However, if you don’t have cloves (or strongly dislike them), you have the option to omit them entirely. Regarding ginger, it is an essential ingredient but is open to adjustment. Feel free to use a reduced amount if desired.

### **Peanut Butter Blossoms**

![christmas cookies recipe](images/christmas-cookies-recipe-6.jpg "christmas-cookies-recipe-6")

Legend has it that the inception of these cookies traces back to Mrs. Freda F. Smith of Ohio, who crafted the initial recipe for The Grand National Pillsbury Bake-Off contest in 1957.

Although she didn’t clinch victory, her cookies achieved iconic status, notably gaining prominence when Pillsbury established the esteemed Bake-Off Hall of Fame and honored her creation by ranking it 7th among the esteemed recipes. Consider this a fascinating tidbit!

### **White Chocolate Cranberry Orange Biscotti**

![christmas cookies recipe](images/christmas-cookies-recipe-7.jpg "christmas-cookies-recipe-7")

Numerous confections pride themselves on being perfect accompaniments to coffee or tea, yet none can compare to the delightful crispness and crunchiness of the unassuming biscotti. Infused with the timeless blend of cranberry and orange, these biscotti are elevated by a decadent touch – a dip in luscious white chocolate, followed by a generous coating of finely chopped pistachios, creating an additional layer of indulgence.

Indulge in the allure of classic snickerdoodles: delectably sweet and buttery sugar cookies, adorned with a dusting of cinnamon-sugar.

While their appearance might be unassuming, these irresistible cookies boast a luxurious and buttery essence, featuring a delicate balance between a crunchy, sugary outer layer and a tender, chewy inner texture. The hidden components behind their charm? Cream cheese imparts a gentle tenderness to the cookies and a subtle touch of almond extract, enhancing the overall profile with a delightful almond undertone.

### **Double Chocolate Biscotti**

![christmas cookies recipe](images/christmas-cookies-recipe-14.jpg "christmas-cookies-recipe-14")

The logic is clear – biscotti, intentionally baked twice to achieve a dry and crispy texture perfect for dipping into tea or coffee, are generously infused with chocolate. While they might exude an air of sophisticated indulgence, these treats also hold a special appeal for children. Pair them with a steaming mug of hot chocolate or warm milk for dipping, and you’ll witness immense delight on the faces of your little ones.

Drawing inspiration from the delectable cookies found at San Francisco’s Zuni Cafe, these biscotti are crafted through a process involving shaping an almond-infused cookie dough into loaves, baking, slicing, and then baking once more. Elegantly balanced in their sweetness, possessing a gentle buttery essence, and delivering a satisfying crunch without being overly hard, these biscotti prove themselves as delightful treat suitable for any moment throughout the day.
