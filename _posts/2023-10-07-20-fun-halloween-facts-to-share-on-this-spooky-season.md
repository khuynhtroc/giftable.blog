## **Unlock the mysteries of Halloween facts’ ancient origins**

As the leaves turn and the nights grow longer, the world gears up for Halloween—a beloved holiday celebrated worldwide. But have you ever wondered about the true story behind this spooky and enchanting [Halloween tradition](https://avada.io/loveable/blog/halloween-traditions/)?

The roots of Halloween facts trace back to the ancient Celts of Ireland, who marked the new year on November 1. It symbolized the transition from the vibrant and fruitful summer months to the cold and dark winter—a time that held associations with death. On October 31, the night preceding the new year, they held a haunting celebration called (cue the spooky voice) Samhain. It was believed that on this night, the boundary between the living and the world of the dead grew thin, allowing ghosts to roam the earth.

These wandering spirits were believed to cause mischief and damage crops. However, the veil between worlds also facilitated Celtic priests in making predictions for the coming year.

As part of their commemoration, the priests built towering bonfires, serving as the focal point for the night’s activities. People donned disguises to ward off malevolent spirits, fortunes were told, lavish feasts were enjoyed, and lanterns were crafted from gourds—an early form of [pumpkin carving](https://avada.io/loveable/blog/halloween-pumpkin/). Curiously, the bonfires attracted insects, which in turn enticed bats to the scene, leading to the association of these winged creatures with Halloween.

With the spread of Christianity into Celtic lands, the holiday’s pagan traditions gradually merged with Christian celebrations. The name “Halloween” derived from “All Hallows’ Eve,” with “All Hallows” referring to the Christian All Souls’ Day observed on November 1.

## **Some of the cherished Halloween facts about customs**

The playful tradition of bobbing for apples – traditional Halloween facts – may have been introduced through early Roman conquests, as the Romans associated apples with their own fall holiday. As for the eerie reputation of black cats, its roots date back to the Middle Ages when many believed that witches could [transform into black cats](https://avada.io/loveable/halloween-cat-costume-for-adults/) to elude detection.

The classic Halloween colors, black and orange, hearken back to the Celtic festival of Samhain. For the Celts, black symbolized the “death” of summer, while orange represented the bountiful harvest season.
