Be sure to have some in stock.

Pumpkins, pumpkins,

Around the house.

I have a lot of keys

And a mouse, too.

With piercing force, I dole out fate

Over bloodless victims, I proclaim my might

I can eternally join with one bite.

What am I?

A Nightmare on Elm Street,

Be careful not to go to sleep.

I can cook faster than anyone else,

And I also go beep, beep!
