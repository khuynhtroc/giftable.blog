### **1\. “Retirement” By William Wordsworth**

![Poems About Retirement](images/screenshot_529-960x601-1.jpg "screenshot_529-960x601-1")

“Retirement” is a poem written by the renowned English Romantic poet William Wordsworth. Wordsworth, known for his deep appreciation of the natural world, uses vivid imagery and introspective reflections to convey the transformative power of retreating from the busyness of life. In this poem, he contemplates the joys and solace of retiring to a quiet and idyllic natural setting, where one can find respite from the demands of society and connect with the beauty of the surrounding environment. “Retirement” is a contemplative piece that invites readers to reflect on the restorative qualities of withdrawing from the world and embracing the serenity of nature.

> “If the whole weight of what we think and feel,
> 
> Save only far as thought and feeling blend
> 
> With action, were as nothing, patriot Friend!
> 
> From thy remonstrance would be no appeal;
> 
> But to promote and fortify the weal
> 
> Of our own Being is her paramount end;
> 
> A truth which they alone shall comprehend
> 
> Who shun the mischief which they cannot heal.
> 
> Peace in these feverish times is sovereign bliss:
> 
> Here, with no thirst but what the stream can slake,
> 
> And startled only by the rustling brake,
> 
> Cool air I breathe; while the unincumbered Mind
> 
> By some weak aims at services assigned
> 
> To gentle Natures, thanks not Heaven amiss.”

### **2\. “Some Days retired from the rest” By Emily Dickinson**

“Some Days retired from the rest” is a poem written by the renowned American poet Emily Dickinson (1830-86).

> “That is no country for old men. The young
> 
> In one another’s arms, birds in the trees,
> 
> —Those dying generations—at their song,
> 
> The salmon-falls, the mackerel-crowded seas,
> 
> Fish, flesh, or fowl, commend all summer long
> 
> Whatever is begotten, born, and dies.
> 
> Caught in that sensual music all neglect
> 
> Monuments of unageing intellect …”

### **4\. ‘Sympathy in White Major’ by Philip Larkin**

![Poems About Retirement](images/screenshot_525-960x598-1.jpg "screenshot_525-960x598-1")

“Sympathy in White Major” by Philip Larkin not only features a mouth-watering description of making a gin and tonic, but it also delves into the intricate connection between oneself and society. Like many of Larkin’s poems, it explores the dynamic between the individual and the world that surrounds them, offering insights into the complexities of our relationship with society.

> “When I drop four cubes of ice
> 
> Chimingly in a glass, and add
> 
> Three goes of gin, a lemon slice,
> 
> And let a ten-ounce tonic void
> 
> In foaming gulps until it smothers
> 
> Everything else up to the edge,
> 
> I lift the lot in private pledge:
> 
> He devoted his life to others.
> 
> While other people wore like clothes
> 
> The human beings in their days
> 
> I set myself to bring to those
> 
> Who thought I could the lost displays;
> 
> It didn’t work for them or me,
> 
> But all concerned were nearer thus
> 
> (Or so we thought) to all the fuss
> 
> Than if we’d missed it separately.
> 
> A decent chap, a real good sort,
> 
> Straight as a die, one of the best,
> 
> A brick, a trump, a proper sport,
> 
> Head and shoulders above the rest;
> 
> How many Iives would have been duller
> 
> Had he not been here below?
> 
> Here’s to the whitest man I know –
> 
> Though white is not my favourite colour.”

### **5\. ‘Warning’ by Jenny Joseph**

“Warning,” written in 1961 by Jenny Joseph, is a globally beloved poem that celebrates old age as a time for indulgence and fun. The poem’s character, a middle-aged woman, imagines herself as a cheeky rebel in later years, inspiring conferences, funerals, and bringing joy to people of all ages worldwide.

> “When I am an old woman I shall wear purple
> 
> With a red hat which doesn’t go, and doesn’t suit me.
> 
> And I shall spend my pension on brandy and summer gloves
> 
> And satin sandals, and say we’ve no money for butter.
> 
> I shall sit down on the pavement when I’m tired
> 
> And gobble up samples in shops and press alarm bells
> 
> And run my stick along the public railings
> 
> And make up for the sobriety of my youth.
> 
> I shall go out in my slippers in the rain
> 
> And pick flowers in other people’s gardens
> 
> And learn to spit.
> 
> You can wear terrible shirts and grow more fat
> 
> And eat three pounds of sausages at a go
> 
> Or only bread and pickle for a week
> 
> And hoard pens and pencils and beermats and things in boxes.
> 
> But now we must have clothes that keep us dry
> 
> And pay our rent and not swear in the street
> 
> And set a good example for the children.
> 
> We must have friends to dinner and read the papers.
> 
> But maybe I ought to practise a little now?
> 
> So people who know me are not too shocked and surprised
> 
> When suddenly I am old, and start to wear purple.”

The musical contribution came from John Newton, while the poet William Cowper penned the lyrics. Within a Christian context, this poem paints a serene and captivating image of retirement, conveying a sense of tranquility and peace.

> Far from the world, O Lord, I flee,
> 
> From strife and tumult far;
> 
> From scenes where Satan wages still
> 
> His most successful war.
> 
> The calm retreat, the silent shade,
> 
> With prayer and praise agree;
> 
> And seem, by Thy sweet bounty made,
> 
> For those who follow Thee …

> 
> Comes sudden on my heart, and I am glad
