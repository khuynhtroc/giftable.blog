### **Dinner Party**

Hosting a dinner party is an excellent birthday idea for teenagers who have outgrown kid activities but aren’t yet independent enough to go out on their own.

Teenagers are more independent than young children, but it’s still important to have an adult nearby during a sleepover to ensure their safety and well-being.

### **Backyard Movie Night**

One of the most beloved ideas for an at-home birthday party among teens is hosting a movie night. Actually, this idea is suitable for all ages. 

You can organize a movie marathon featuring all your teen’s favorite films. If you own a movie projector, you can even turn it into an outdoor movie night.

If you opt for an online gathering, consider delivering a gaming pack with snacks for everyone to enjoy while playing. If hosting it in person, take turns playing levels and cheer each other on for added excitement.

### **Scavenger Hunt**

Engage the kids and get them active with a fun scavenger hunt during the party. Turn it into a selfie scavenger hunt to keep teenagers and pre-teens interested. Give them a list of objects to find and encourage them to use their cell phones to capture pictures of each item. Divide the teenagers into teams and see which team can check off the most items on their scavenger hunt list. Remember to set a time limit so they know when to be back to the starting point.

### **Game Truck**

Another option is to bring the gaming party to your doorstep by hiring a game truck. It’s a convenient and exciting way to accommodate many kids playing video games simultaneously. After the gaming session, you can continue the celebration with a pizza party and birthday cake at home or in the garage.
