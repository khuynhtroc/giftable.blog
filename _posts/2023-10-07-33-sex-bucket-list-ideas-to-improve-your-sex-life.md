Sex is an important aspect of every good relationship and may help couples become closer. Creating an effective sex bucket list might assist in boosting sexual satisfaction and liven up an otherwise boring sex life. A **sex bucket list** allows partners to explore their sexual needs, fantasies, and limitations.

It might be uncomfortable to discuss sex, but it is critical to be open and honest with your partner. Discussing dreams and wants can assist in improving a couple’s relationship and open the door to attempting new and exciting things. Couples should also discuss limits and expectations, as well as establish ground rules for love-making activities. Whatever activities are on the list, couples should ensure that they are within their comfort zone and that they are able to check off each item on the list. 

This **sex bucket list** below is a terrific approach to improving your sex life and may provide a lot of enjoyment for both parties. It doesn’t have to be a large or complicated list; just make sure it includes things that both you and your companion like. There are several methods to spice up your sex life and keep things fresh and exciting, ranging from trying out new sex positions to taking a sexy class.

## **33 Sex Bucket List Ideas to Improve your Sex Life**

### **1\. Have shower sex: Tips and Position** 

Let’s imagine what you can do in the shower; it’s amazing to “clean up” together. In the bathroom, where you can take off clothes without shyness, you can’t resist looking at the other person in such a charming pose. There are enough items for cuddling in every position you want, then show off what you can do in this steamy space.

### **2\. Study Shibari**

“Shibari” simply means “to tie” in Japanese. Shibari’s modern connotation refers to an old Japanese aesthetic style of rope bondage. In sex, you can generally understand it with a little bit of dark and violent meaning. What is used to tie, and who is tied? After answering these [questions about sex](https://avada.io/loveable/sex-questions-to-ask-before-marriage/), you get how it works.

### **3\. Play with all forms of bondage.**

![Play with all forms of bondage](images/sexbucket-list-4.jpg "sexbucket-list-4")

Play with all forms of bondage

If you are professional in sex, you have certainly heard of BDSM. It is a popular form of love-making on the sex bucket list of those who love thrills. It is believed that it causes pain for others because of rough tools. Surely, but some like that. They would like to treat themselves like a slave, these bondage toys torture them, but that’s actually what they’re enjoying. Transforming torment into pleasure is one of the unique things that love-making can do.

### **4\. Take part in a sex party**

Don’t see it as the sick in the head! Look at the bright side. A party is an opportunity for newbies to learn something new. It’s even more wonderful if you are single because you probably catch someone enough to satisfy you. It’s just awkward when thinking that everyone is looking at you. However, they are enjoying their party, not taking care of you, so don’t think that you are the hub of the universe. Take advantage to find the climax.

### **5\. Visit a sex resort on vacation**

![Visit a sex resort on vacation](images/sexbucket-list-10.jpg "sexbucket-list-10")

Visit a sex resort on vacation

If you are bored spending time on usual vacations, it’s high time to check out a new experience that is especially unforgettable. There are many available new sex resorts; take your phone for booking on the Internet. A new environment, as well as a luxurious space for enjoying sex, is one of the highest ranks on the sex bucket list. In a new space, the way you play with your partner is also different. For example, what do you think about making love in the pool of the resort with the view of the beach? Would you like to try it once?

### **6\. Get a threesome**

“Threesome” is the term used for having sex with 3 participants. It’s a great deal to find new feelings along with 3rd person. In the traditional style with 2, there are a dozen of positions, but with the threesome style, it goes up to a hundred positions. You can find them on the Internet, which is quite popular right now on the sex bucket list. 

### **7\. Utilize a sex toy with your beloved** 

“Threesome” is the term used for having sex with 3 participants. It’s a great deal to find new feelings along with 3rd person. In the traditional style with 2, there are a dozen of positions, but with the threesome style, it goes up to a hundred positions. Experiencing with threesome will be one of the best sex memories, and every time you recall it, you really get hooked on the play. 

### **8\. Sexy role play in the bedroom**

![Sexy role play in the bedroom](images/sexbucket-list-8.jpg "sexbucket-list-8")

Sexy role play in the bedroom

Don’t say that you have never ever watched types of films like this before. That’s a big omission to enrich your lovemaking knowledge. They are kinds of content with titles like “The teacher and the student”, “The owner and the maid”, “the landlady and the plumber”, “The doctor and the nurse”, etc. Turn all daily activities into evil. You know that making love in the school or hospital is unbelievable, so decorate your room and yourself to create a new environment for new experiences. Make your dreams come true, something you’ve never dared to try before. Become the ruler or be ruled in this role-playing game.

### **9\. Wank while wearing a penis sleeve**

Back to the time you have to do it yourself without any support. Poor you, but now we have an inventory of toys to choose from in the Sex toy stores. Too familiar with using your hand, let a soft penis sleeve bring you to the peak. It can be used by you, or even better; your partner will help you. Do you want to try a new feeling of excitement?

### **10\. Use a blindfold during sex**

Blindfolds are a popular and exciting method to spice up your sex life. For those who are interested in discovering the realm of BDSM, adding a blindfold to the mix may take the experience to a whole new level. Wearing a blindfold might help you boost sensations and succumb to your partner’s desires.

Blindfolds may be a fun way to start a night of pleasure and discovery. When you’re blinded, you’re more in tune with your senses, which might heighten the intensity of the experience. Your other senses are heightened, making it possible for your spouse to entice you with unexpected touches or remarks. It may also offer a new level of trust to your relationship as you entirely surrender to your lover and trust them to take care of you.

### **11\. Get intimate on the sand**

![Get intimate on the sand](images/sexbucket-list-9.jpg "sexbucket-list-9")

Get intimate on the sand

Make sure you can do this crazy sex idea together without the witness of others. The best sand here is from the magnificent beach where you can observe the beauty of nature. How amazing would it be if you had sex in a view like that? Wow. Your and his/her sweat on the battlefield will be swept by the cool breezes. The sand covers the body and creates a sense of mystery in the short break, watching the waves and the bay together. 

### **12\. Sort of engaging in public sex**

The public here can be understood that you have sexual intercourse in the crowd. Everywhere you can think about, such as a party, public toilet, or even cinema, as long as you are in a group having the same idea as you. What is the difference? You can see more, learn more and test more. Pick someone random and check out if they can satisfy you. There are many groups on social media platforms welcoming new members; dare you?

![Sort of engaging in public sex](images/sexbucket-list-3.jpg "sexbucket-list-3")

Sort of engaging in public sex

### **13\. Sex when stoned**

Stimulant is sometimes the best type of medicine for physical and mental health. If you got a mental disease, your emotion is immediately pushed after a try. An amazing function that is hard to find in western medicines. Sex is the elixir for mental; how it’s wonderful if sex combines to stone. You will truly forget about the worst things in life; illusion makes you like a God.

### **14\. Implement nipple clamps**

![Implement nipple clamps](images/sexbucket-list-11.jpg "sexbucket-list-11")

Implement nipple clamps

The nipple is one of the most sensitive points of women, the position where you make them happy or hurt. Normally, the hand and mouth are things to play with nipples, but is it really happy when doing a long time with basic skills? Don’t estimate this point because this is the premise for successful lovemaking. To meet that need, nipple clamps have been produced to excite women. 

### **15\. Attempt pegging**

Pegging is often used to describe a sexual act between heterosexual partners. This is partly due to the gender-role reversal: the fact that a woman is piercing the guy. When a guy is pegged, he is entered from behind by a penis prosthesis tool. It sounds interesting, right! If you are male, you don’t have to be active as usual to show your masculinity. Lie still and see what your girlfriend will do to please you. On the other hand, the girls will show their boys how they’ve been abused.

### **16\. Employ a butt plug**

![Employ a butt plug](images/sexbucket-list-2-1.jpg "sexbucket-list-2-1")

Employ a butt plug

The butt plug is a type of sex toy used to put into the back of men as you plug in the power outlet, like that. It sounds so bad; imagine someone stabbing your ass from behind; painful! However, you cannot judge when you have never tested before. It’s believed that players will be addicted after a try because it is a fact that the point that makes men happiest is the prostate through the ass hole. When the tool can reach this point, the guys will burst with satisfaction instead of the pain as imagination.

### **17\. Give prostate massage a try**

Give a surprise massage to his prostate; men also will reach climax. Using your dexterous fingertips to elate even the most demanding men. Besides, it not only brings excitement but also helps to improve health conditions. Thanks to its benefit, you should consider readily buying some toy machines to support the cuddling process smoothly.

### **18\. Enjoy anal sex**

![Enjoy anal sex](images/sexbucket-list-7.jpg "sexbucket-list-7")

Enjoy anal sex

A strong feeling is that instead of making love traditionally through girls’ vaginas, they go through assholes. Anal sex is the best idea on the sex bucket list to hit your partner in another way. It is a fact that both have a hole to put in, so it’s fairer for the girls that they can actively destroy their boys with cock toys. Let’s show what they have done in your body. For boys, you also give girls the times cunting that are more memorable than ever.

### **19\. Have super-hot quickie sex**

Maybe it’s stupid because we mostly love having long-lasting sex all day. However, we cannot always enjoy it every time. There are many things outside as an adult. They have to suffer various pressures from work to family. Working, cooking, looking after kids, etc. Do you have enough times to balance these tasks? 

Many other obligations and hassles come with life; that’s the reason why, when your schedule gets hectic, taking out just a few minutes to be intimate with your partner might feel difficult. Super-hot quickie sex is suitable for this; it speeds up but still has to achieve the best results.

### **20\. Consider sexy nudes**

![Consider sexy nudes](images/sexbucket-list-6.jpg "sexbucket-list-6")

Consider sexy nudes

A sexy nude is a form of strong seduction. In that way, you absolutely make your partner out of control and lose his/her mind. When seeing each part of your body revealed, he/she will be a wild animal that is ready to rush to bite you. Depending on what type of mate they want, you can cosplay like that. For example, if they like shy and naive girls, don’t give the full-body nude but leave the parts they want to explore the most. Slit underwear can be a bold idea for that to activate your lover’s wild instincts.

### **21\. Create a sex tape**

Capture crazy moments of lovemaking between you and your partner in movies. Consider that as a collection of what you have done with your partner. Rewatch the facial reactions and skills to improve for the next time; otherwise, ignite the desire of both again. There is a popular idea that recording each position has been done; the two will update extra ones in case there is any shortage.

### **22\. With your partner, watch porn**

![With your partner, watch porn](images/sexbucket-list-13.jpg "sexbucket-list-13")

With your partner, watch porn

There is no shortage of online porn channels on the Internet for your reference. It’s a terrific approach to finding and preparing for your shared desires! Let’s take each other somewhere where you’re sure you can have sex as soon as you watch it; there’s no way you can’t stand it after watching such content. If your partner agrees to watch them with you, they are quietly sending a signal that they want to have an intimate. Watching porn alone was in the past; now, it is easy to make your own film.

### **23\. Try edging**

To the uninformed, halting an orgasm right before it begins may sound uncomfortable. However, for those who have tried it, this technique is known as “edging” is employed to increase sexual pleasure more than ever. This is a very annoying way of teasing your partner, and it’s also hard to do because you need to adjust the time – it can be 5 minutes to 10 minutes. 

### **24\. Attempt to learn how to pompoir**

![Attempt to learn how to pompoir](images/sexbucket-list-12.jpg "sexbucket-list-12")

Attempt to learn how to pompoir

First, what is the term “pompoir”? Pompoir is the process of stimulating the penis during intercourse by manipulating the vaginal muscles in various ways. It sounds hard to do because being able to control her vaginal muscles proves that she’s also a pro at it. Playing with sensitive areas, so be very careful not to hurt anyone.

### **25\. Have silent sex**

It’s too common that make love while having dirty talks for pushing euphoria. However, in some cases, silences are the best alternative for slight sex. No moans, no dirty talks, and try not to make any noise from start to end. Instead, each other can learn to contact through eyes, gestures, and facial expressions. When someone is happy, you can get that from their posture. Crying is sad, but crying while smiling is the maximum excitement that cannot be expressed verbally.

### **26\. Orgasm denial will turn up the heat even more**

Weirdly, It’s known that orgasm is what mates try to reach in sex, so orgasm denial seems to be a villain ruining everything. If you’ve perfected the art of tormenting your spouse without succumbing, try allowing yourself to be pushed to the edge of orgasm but without really orgasming – one of the most annoying types of sex for your partner on the sex bucket list.

### **27\. Use a tingling clitoral arousal gel**

There are many types of items to support love-making processing perfectly. Tingling clitoral arousal gel is the one that should be put on the list to make your partner hornier than ever. Pour them into the clitoris and smooth it, stroking it teasingly to stimulate it; guess how long they can endure. Not only affect girls but can the boys control themself against this scent? It is wet and slippery; what would you do next? 

### **28\. Order a sex toy that you haven’t tried before**

![Order a sex toy that you haven't tried before](images/sexbucket-list-14.jpg "sexbucket-list-14")

Order a sex toy that you haven’t tried before

As mentioned above, sex toys are getting more and more diverse nowadays to serve for demands of people, and it’s impossible to test all of them. Therefore, if you are afraid of being judged to go to the store to choose, let’s surf the online market to purchase the ones you are interested in. Otherwise, you can check their material, function, and how to use it easily in the description.

Sex toys are believed to be powerful tools for mates in sex life. When we are too familiar with traditional positions, the participation of new friends is perfect for refreshing the two’s emotions.

### **29\. Buy a sex game**

Setting some rules will be more interesting for the gameplay. Before pouncing on each other, offer some difficult conditions to make it difficult for your partner. The harder something is to achieve, the more interesting it is, right? For example, Jenga is a simple game for children; what if you set a rule that every time someone loses, take off one of their body items? Using this form will curb the desire until it really explodes when the opponent is almost naked.

### **30\. Write a story about you and your partner that is sexual**

![Write a story about you and your partner that is sexual](images/sexbucket-list-5.jpg "sexbucket-list-5")

Write a story about you and your partner that is sexual

Jot down anything you have done or your imagination in sexual. Sharing your desired story that is hoped to be the truth. Let’s show your partner your intention to see her/his reaction and whether they can make that with you or not. It’s great to write a love story together in which both two fully burn out to reach fulfillment.

### **31\. Try a sex toy on your own and tell your partner how it went**

Trying a sex toy on your own may be a pleasurable and energizing experience that you can share with your partner. Try different positions to find the one that is most comfortable for you. Start by exploring your body, and then gradually work up to using the toy. When you’re ready to tell your partner about your encounter, make sure you tell them everything. 

Describe the sensations, pleasure, and anticipation of orgasm. Include any issues or concerns you had during the event. This will make your partner feel more at ease and confident while using their own sex toy. If you’re not sure which toy to acquire, consult with your mate. They could have some good ideas about what to buy.

### **32\. Have your partner try out a sex toy alone and then tell you about it**

An opposite idea compared to the above. Your partner will select what will make them happy the most. You can also require to see as a learner to prepare for the next time. It’s also a chance to witness what your mate is when he/she is satisfied. Their expression will be really lovely in the eye of the beholder.

### **33\. Give someone a sexy massage**

It’s wonderful to be petted and delighted with the skills you’ve learned. Learn skills by taking a class or learning them online before you apply them to your partner. Do you know where they want to be touched the most? It’s certainly sensitive areas in the body. Do it slowly and sexy; also observe their facial expressions and gestures to ensure you do it right. Besides, set an awkward mood and start teasing; they will surely be over restless and horny.
