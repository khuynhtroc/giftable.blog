## **37\. Voldemort (Harry Potter series)**

![Halloween Cartoon Characters](images/voldemort-harry-potter-series.jpg "voldemort-harry-potter-series")

Some believe Voldemort’s name was inspired by Edgar Allan Poe’s decaying character, M. Valdemar, but the truth lies in J.K. Rowling’s love for French, resulting in the moniker meaning “flight of death.” Rowling wanted a name that conveyed power and exoticism for the formidable Death Eater Supreme. Voldemort indeed lives up to these descriptions, being a chilling blend of man and snake, with a slit nose and cold-blooded nature. His mastery of dark magic is so complete that he can fly without a broomstick, and his presence looms in every shadow.

![Halloween Cartoon Characters](images/hannibal-lecter-the-silence-of-the-lambs.jpg "hannibal-lecter-the-silence-of-the-lambs")

While most great villains are defined by their actions, it’s Hopkins’ stillness that makes him truly unsettling. When staring at Jodie Foster’s Starling through toughened glass, he unnervingly peels away her layers with softly spoken words. Lecter’s horrific acts are more implied than shown, yet his tongue proves as deadly as a blade or bullet. Though somewhat diluted by later adaptations, Lecter remains a captivating and formidable foe.

## **39\. The Joker (The Joker)**

![Halloween Cartoon Characters](images/the-joker-the-joker.jpg "the-joker-the-joker")

The Joker, originating as a maniac in comic books, evolved through various portrayals, from Cesar Romero’s campy version on screens to Mark Hamill’s animated take. Tim Burton and Jack Nicholson brought darker shades in the 1989 movie re-invention. However, Chris Nolan and Heath Ledger found the perfect form for the character in The Dark Knight (2008), grounding him in a more realistic film universe. 

Ledger’s Joker is a captivating embodiment of ugly beauty, relentless in achieving his aims, and as Michael Caine’s Alfred puts it, he just wants to watch the world burn. Joaquin Phoenix’s portrayal in Todd Phillips’ Joker showcased the character independently, without the presence of Batman, earning him an Oscar-winning performance

## **Bottom Line** 

The captivating world of **Halloween cartoon characters** has left an enduring impression on our hearts and minds.
