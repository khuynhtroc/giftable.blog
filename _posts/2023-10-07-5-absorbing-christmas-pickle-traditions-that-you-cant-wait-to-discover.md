The **Christmas pickle tradition** has a fascinating origin. Legend has it that a weary and kind-hearted Civil War soldier held captive in a dungeon begged for a pickle as his last meal before being saved. To honor this tale of hope and preservation, families now hide a pickle ornament in their Christmas tree, and the sharp-eyed individual who finds it is blessed with an extra dose of good fortune for the upcoming year.

## **What is the Christmas Pickle Tradition?** 

![What is the Christmas Pickle Tradition?](images/what-is-the-christmas-pickle-tradition-960x578-1.jpg "what-is-the-christmas-pickle-tradition-960x578-1")

A pickle ornament gets tucked among the boughs between the time the tree is set up and December 25. The hunt starts on Christmas morning, and whoever finds the pickle receives the first present or an additional gift, as well as good luck for the rest of the year! It’s a delightfully hilarious moment that kids usually like.

Additionally, the practice encourages children to calm down and appreciate Christmas morning rather than ripping through their toys.

## **Origins of the Christmas Pickle Tradition**

Though it’s a popular misconception among Americans, this custom is known as a “Weihnachtsgurke” (Christmas Pickle in English) and is considered from Germany. It has been hypothesized that Christmas pickles might have emerged in the 1890s to correspond with the introduction of German glass ornaments for Christmas trees.

However, it has been argued that the custom originated during the American Civil War. Private John C. Lower – a Bavarian soldier who had joined the 103rd Pennsylvania Infantry, was taken prisoner in April 1864 and placed there. According to the legend, he asked a guard for a pickle on Christmas Eve because he was starving. The guard gave him the pickle, which Lower later said saved his life. After being released, he started hiding a pickle on a Christmas tree as a tradition annually.

## **Where Can You Get a Christmas Pickle Ornament?**
