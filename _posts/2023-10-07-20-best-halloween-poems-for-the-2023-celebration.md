The year is 2015, and the poet paints a somber picture of a dark day with the moon shining bright against the oil-black sky.

Amidst the Halloween revelry, a deeper truth emerges, revealing the stark disparities in society.

_of extinction — pray for us — because even tomorrow_

_will be haunted — leave them, leave us, leave —”_

‘Rober Burns’ ‘Halloween,’ written in 1785 and first published in 1786 as part of the Kilmarnock Edition, is a lesser-known yet significant poem.

_Syne, wi’ a social glass o’ strunt,_

_They parted aff careerin’_

_Fu’ blythe that night.”_

### **8\. Theme In Yellow by Carl Sandburg**

![Halloween by Arthur Peterson](images/theme-in-yellow-by-carl-sandburg.jpg "theme-in-yellow-by-carl-sandburg")

In the poem ‘Theme in Yellow,’ Halloween night unfolds from the unique perspective of a pumpkin. The speaker, personified as the pumpkin, shares its journey from a small yellow ball to a fully matured orange or tawny fruit, ready to play its role as a Jack-o-lantern on Halloween. As the festivities approach, children gather around the pumpkin, joining hands and singing ghost songs in joyful celebration. Unlike the typical spooky associations with Halloween and Jack-o-lanterns, this poem presents a lighter, more cheerful sense of the day.

**Excerpt for You**

_With yellow balls in autumn._

_(…)_

_I am fooling.”_

### **9\. All Hallows by Louise Glück**

![All Hallows by Louise Glück](images/all-hallows-by-louise-gluck.jpg "all-hallows-by-louise-gluck")

“All Hallows,” the shortened title for “All Hallows’ Eve,” marks the evening before All Saints’ Day, symbolizing the end of the harvest season. Late October sets in, and the earth begins its slumber, knowing it won’t grow for a while. The poet beautifully depicts the conclusion of the harvest, with bare fields and animals safely sheltered in barns.

In the poem, a sense of death looms, embodied by the wife who extends her hand to the spirit. As if nurturing the spirit, she offers it seeds, invoking its resurrection now that the earth’s harvesting is complete. The poem beautifully weaves themes of life and death, celebrating the transition from a bountiful harvest to the somber stillness of winter, all observed on this enchanting night of All Hallows.

**Excerpt for You**

_“Even now this landscape is assembling._

_The hills darken. The oxen_

_sleep in their blue yoke,_

_(…)_

_And the soul creeps out of the tree.”_

### **10\. Halloween by John Mayne**

The poem, comprising twelve stanzas and published in Ruddiman’s Weekly Magazine, vividly captures the mischievous pranks that unfold on Halloween night, evoking a sense of both excitement and fear: “What fearful pranks ensue!” Additionally, the poem touches on the spooky aspect associated with the night, with mentions of “Bogies” or ghosts.

Mayne’s composition evidently left an impact on Robert Burns, as he seems to engage with Mayne’s work in his own poem titled ‘Halloween.’ In this way, the two poets share a common theme, and Burns echoes some of Mayne’s imagery in his own creative expression. ‘Halloween’ by John Mayne serves as a timeless reminder of the spirit of fun and mischief that permeates this enchanting night of celebration.

**Excerpt for You**

_“OF a’ the festivals we hear,_

_Frae Handsel-Monday till New Year,_

_There’s few in Scotland held mair dear_

_(…)_

_Till death in everlasting bliss_

_Shall steek their e’en,_

_Will ever be the constant wish of_

_Jockie Mein.”_

### **11\. The Raven by Edgar Allan Poe**

![Halloween by John Mayne](images/the-raven-by-edgar-allan-poe.jpg "the-raven-by-edgar-allan-poe")

Poe’s most popular poem, ‘The Raven,’ encompasses his recurring themes of loss, death, fear, and the eerie presence of a talking raven. The bird’s haunting cry of “Nevermore” echoes throughout this supernatural and dream-like piece. Undoubtedly, this chilling poem ranks among the scariest examples in English literature, making it an ideal choice for a night of spine-tingling terror.

**Excerpt for You**

_“Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,_

_Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—_

    _While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,_

_As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.”_

### **12\. The Vampire by Conrad Aiken** 

![The Vampire by Conrad Aiken](images/the-vampire-by-conrad-aiken.jpg "the-vampire-by-conrad-aiken")

In ‘The Vampire,’ Aiken delves into the emergence of profound evil and the choices confronted by mankind in its wake. The poem commences with the speaker and his companions witnessing the arrival of a formidable being—a woman possessing power over darkness, a vampire. As her presence engulfs the world, terrifying darkness descends upon the sky. 

Though her words are initially obscure, they eventually become clear, enticing those who join her with promises of wonders, while warning deniers of unholy deaths. As the violence subsides, the night retreats, revealing the aftermath—bodies scattered across the field and trees stained with crimson blood.

**Excerpt for You**

_“She rose among us where we lay._

_She wept, we put our work away._

_She chilled our laughter, stilled our play;_

_And spread a silence there.”_

### **13\. The Haunted Palace by Edgar Allan Poe**

![The Haunted Palace by Edgar Allan Poe](images/the-haunted-palace-by-edgar-allan-poe.jpg "the-haunted-palace-by-edgar-allan-poe")

In Poe’s short story “The Fall of the House of Usher,” ‘The Haunted Palace’ is a chilling and eerily realistic portrayal of insanity. This haunting poem illustrates a decaying structure and its residents, mirroring the gradual deterioration of the human mind. The house becomes a potent metaphor for the human psyche, as its decline reflects the unraveling of one’s sanity. Poe skillfully draws parallels between these two distinct structures, crafting a powerful and unsettling narrative.

**Excerpt for You**

_“In the greenest of our valleys_

_By good angels tenanted,_

_Once a fair and stately palace—_

_Radiant palace—reared its head._

_In the monarch Thought’s dominion,_

_It stood there!”_

**Read the full poem at** [**poetryfoundation**](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/52370/the-haunted-palace)

### **14\. Omens by Cecilia Llompart** 

In Cecilia Llompart’s ‘Omens,’ a strange and chilling poem, haunting images blend to explore omens, oracles, nostalgia, and dreams. The speaker’s perspective shifts to the first person in the second half, leading the reader through eerie dreams that leave them gasping for breath. The poem culminates with two thought-provoking rhetorical questions, pondering the future and what might be lost, as well as reflecting on what has already been left behind in the past. This captivating poem weaves a tapestry of dark and entrancing themes, evoking a sense of mystery and foreboding.

**Excerpt for You**

_“The dead bird, color of a bruise,_

_and smaller than an eye_

_swollen shut,_

_is king among omens._

_Who can blame the ants for feasting?_

_Let him cast the first crumb.”_

**Read the full poem at** [**Poets**](https://poets.org/poem/omens)

### **15\. All Hallows’ Eve by Dorothea Tanning**

![All Hallows’ Eve by Dorothea Tanning](images/all-hallows-eve-by-dorothea-tanning.jpg "all-hallows-eve-by-dorothea-tanning")

In the concise fourteen-line poem, ‘All Hallows’ Eve,’ Tanning skillfully paints a vivid picture of night, darkness, and pain. With striking language, she describes bones cracking and doom sneaking in on “rubber treads.” The poem delves into the theme of insanity among housewives, where lipstick serves as a means to tranquilize their fears. 

The final lines present a flurry of alliterative words, mentioning “tasty antidotes” and even a metaphorical werewolf. Tanning’s evocative imagery takes the reader on a haunting journey, exploring a realm of eerie sensations and captivating mysteries.

**Excerpt for You**

_“Be perfect, make it otherwise._

Addison, the first African American to win the Bram Stoker award, has held this prestigious honor four times. Her poem delves deeply into themes of helplessness and cosmic, natural horror, showcasing her exceptional skill. The narrator’s journey into a realm of creeping and whirling dread, whether a literal Hell or a personal one, is a testament to Addison’s ability to craft a haunting and impactful piece.

### **19\. “Ghost Q & A” By  Anne Carson**

Carson’s Ghost Q&A carries a disquieting rhythm, resembling a séance at first glance. Yet, the peculiar tangents in the dialogue, combined with an eerie absence of punctuation, create a strange monotone in the narrators’ exchange. This imparts a sense of helplessness and confusion, while an insistent need to be understood lingers beneath the surface. The portrayal of ghosts in this poem is gently unsettling, leaving a lasting impression. From beginning to end, it is a worthwhile read that will leave you intrigued.

_A are you joking_
