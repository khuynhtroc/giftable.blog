What takes a Halloween party to the next level? **Halloween drinks**! Themed cocktails add a delightful touch to any gathering, and these particular [Halloween punch drinks](https://avada.io/loveable/blog/halloween-punch/) perfectly embody the spooky and neon-colored essence. 

To enhance the experience, some of these beverages even bubble and smoke! While we appreciate the art of traditional cocktails, we couldn’t resist including some of our all-time favorites that align perfectly with the eerie theme, such as Corpse Reviver, Death in the Afternoon, and Zombie, all of which hail from the 1920s. Additionally, we’ve curated a selection of fantastic concoctions from our beloved recipe sources on the web. 

Are you excited to begin the Halloween festivities? Let’s dive in!

## **40 Creepy and Delicious Halloween Drinks to Try**

### **1\. Poison Apple Cocktails**

![halloween drinks](images/halloween-drinks-1.jpg "halloween-drinks-1")

This beverage is entirely focused on the mesmerizing allure of edible glitter (and trust us, we are absolutely obsessed with it!). However, a word of caution: to achieve the fantastic swirling effect, the glitter requires thorough mixing. If you don’t have a cocktail shaker at your disposal, consider using a blender instead!

### **2\. Black Magic Jell-O Shots**

![halloween drinks](images/halloween-drinks-2.jpg "halloween-drinks-2")

These shots, featuring two eerie layers—one purple and one black—are an ideal addition to elevate your upcoming [Halloween party](https://avada.io/loveable/blog/halloween-party-games-adults/). If you’re looking for a delightful accompaniment to enjoy with these shots, you must try making the ridiculously adorable mummy brie. It’s the perfect snack to complement the spooky ambiance!

### **3\. Jekyll & Gin**

![halloween drinks](images/halloween-drinks-3.jpg "halloween-drinks-3")

Prepare yourself for a mind-bending experience with this drink, and that’s even before the alcohol takes effect. Inspired by a Gin Daisy, this cocktail has a fascinating twist: it appears coral in regular daylight but transforms into a glowing white spectacle under a black light, all thanks to the magical properties of tonic water!

### **4\. Witches’ Brew Lemonade**

![halloween drinks](images/halloween-drinks-4.jpg "halloween-drinks-4")

Achieving an eerie glow reminiscent of something concocted in a cauldron was no simple feat.

The results are not only visually striking but also incredibly delicious.

### **5\. Washington Apple Shot**

![halloween drinks](images/halloween-drinks-5.jpg "halloween-drinks-5")

Derived from the classic Washington Apple Cocktail, the Washington Apple Shot brings together whiskey, usually of the Canadian variety, apple schnapps, and cranberry juice. To elevate its flavor profile, we introduced a touch of pomegranate for an added twist! The resulting drink is crisp, aromatic, and rejuvenating—a perfect choice for leisurely sipping and savoring.

### **6\. Harvest Punch**

![halloween drinks](images/halloween-drinks-6.jpg "halloween-drinks-6")

Though cider and ginger beer might initially strike you as an unusual combination, don’t let that deter you. When blended with fresh fruit and cinnamon, and topped with delightful bubbles, we assure you it’s a winning concoction. However, if you’re planning a smaller but equally lively brunch gathering, our caramel apple mimosas would be the perfect alternative choice.

### **7\. Apple Cider Sangria**

![halloween drinks](images/halloween-drinks-7.jpg "halloween-drinks-7")

While Sangria often evokes memories of warm summer nights and tropical fruits, this apple-based cocktail will effortlessly transition you into the cozy embrace of fall. Embracing the spirit of the season, we crafted a delightful white wine sangria, perfectly complemented by the addition of spicy ginger beer and sweet apple cider. Get ready to embrace the autumn vibes with every sip!

![halloween drinks](images/halloween-drinks-8.jpg "halloween-drinks-8")

The Jekyll and Hyde Club in New York City maintains an eternal Halloween atmosphere, but on October 31st, it becomes one of the trendiest destinations in Manhattan. Among their array of popular Halloween drinks, their scary-good tropical rum cocktail stands out as a favorite. Its irresistible appeal has us yearning for Halloween vibes every single day!

### **9\. Apple Cider Mimosas**

![halloween drinks](images/halloween-drinks-9.jpg "halloween-drinks-9")

Mimosas have long been the go-to brunch cocktail, but as the weather turns colder and our taste preferences shift towards cozy, autumn-inspired flavors, sipping on a bright and citrusy drink feels a bit unusual. Enter the perfect solution: a fall twist on the classic mimosa that embraces the comforting essence of the season. It’s a delightful way to toast and celebrate the beauty of autumn!

### **10\. The Zombie Cocktail**

![halloween drinks](images/halloween-drinks-10.jpg "halloween-drinks-10")

Despite its spooky name, the Zombie is actually a refreshing and citrus-forward tiki cocktail that will transport your mind to a sunny day at the beach rather than an invasion of the undead.

 According to legend, the first person to try this potent concoction felt like a zombie for days afterward. However, when we indulge in a Zombie, our main desire is to head straight to the nearest pool party, feeling revitalized and ready for some fun in the sun!

![halloween drinks](images/halloween-drinks-12.jpg "halloween-drinks-12")

Hot buttered rum can be considered the original version of butter beer. Both share the characteristics of a golden hue, delectable sweetness, and a frothy head that might leave you with a whimsical mustache after each sip. Combining rum, butter, sugar, ice cream, and a generous sprinkling of cinnamon results in a heartwarming wintertime concoction that exudes pure magic in every single glass.

This delightful concoction brings together two cherished fall flavors: the irresistible combination of salted caramel and apple. For an extra special touch, consider serving them in apple cups to elevate the presentation. 

If you can’t get your hands on caramel vodka, don’t worry! Regular vodka works just as well, and you can enhance the drink’s appeal with a luscious caramel drizzle garnish. Cheers to enjoying the best of autumn in each sip!

![halloween drinks](images/halloween-drinks-14.jpg "halloween-drinks-14")

Prepare to be amazed by the incredible innovation of light-up Jell-O shots, and the best part is, you probably already have the key ingredient in your pantry: tonic water! To achieve the mesmerizing glow effect, ensure you use pure tonic water, without diluting it with tap water. However, be aware that this choice might result in slightly bitter shots. Get ready for a luminous and thrilling Jell-O shot experience!

### **40\. Aviation Cocktail**

![halloween drinks](images/halloween-drinks-40.jpg "halloween-drinks-40")

Created by New York bartender Hugo Ensslin over a century ago, the Aviation cocktail has experienced periods of popularity and obscurity over the years. Unfortunately, when crème de violette, the essential violet liqueur responsible for its signature purple hue and floral taste, was discontinued in the 1960s, crafting a classic Aviation at home became a near-impossible task. 

However, the cocktail enthusiasts’ prayers were answered when it made a comeback in the mid-2000s. While still challenging to find, devoted fans of this floral delight understand that the effort to locate it is undoubtedly worthwhile.
