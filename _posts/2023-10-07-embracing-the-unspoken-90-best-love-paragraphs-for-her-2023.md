![Cute Love Paragraphs For Her To Brighten Her Day](images/loveparagraph2.jpg "loveparagraph2")

1. Is it already dark there? It is already dark here. There are a large number of stars in the sky. The sky always amazes me. It seems to be limitless without any boundaries. You have a strange resemblance to this sky. You amaze me like this beautiful sky, and my feelings for you have no limitations. I am simply unable to put limits or boundaries on my love for you. It keeps on increasing.
2. The rising sun always brightens my morning. The cool, soothing breeze in the evening cools my thoughts. The singing birds bring untold joy to my heart. However, nothing makes me feel complete like seeing your beautiful face. I love you and will always love you.
3. I want you to know that you are essential in my life. You’re the reason I do everything. When I get up in the morning, I feel so grateful for every second I have with you and have here on earth. You give my life meaning. You give my days such joy. And you are the reason I smile. Thank you for being with me and for joining me on this journey through life. Your love is everything to me.
4. When you came into my life, I left all my past behind me. I just love this newly found love that makes me feel like a baby again, my sugar I adore you so much.
5. I must be the luckiest man in the world to have such a special person for their love. When I am next to you, I am always pinching myself to confirm that what I see is real. You are everything that I ever needed in this life, and I cannot imagine life without you. I love you, darling.
6. A day that is void of your voice is to mean an incomplete one. For with your voice comes soul-melting laughter, which is all I need to have a great and happy day. I hope mine makes you feel the same way. 
7. The sun is rising in the sky, but to me, the day doesn’t start until you’ve risen out of bed. You’re the only source of light and warmth I need, lighting up my life with your smile and warming me with your mere presence. Now that you’ve gotten up and read this, my day has indeed started. Thank you!
8. You’re my best friend. The person I can tell all my secrets to, the first person I want to talk to when I wake up, and the last person I want to talk to before I drift off to sleep. When something good happens to me, you’re the first person I want to tell. When I’m troubled by something or if I get bad news, you’re the one I go to for comfort and support. But you’re so much more to me than a friend; you’re the love of my life. You’re my friend, my lover, my comfort, and my strength. I am so lucky to have you. I just wanted you to know how happy I am to have you in my life.
9. The doctor took an x-ray of my heart and I almost fainted. He asked me what had happened with a scared look on his face. I told him, don’t worry, I gave my heart to you. That’s why it is missing.
10. Watching you walk across a room is the greatest gift. The way you move is so graceful and effortless. The way you smile makes me feel at peace. Knowing you’re walking towards me is a feeling so hard to describe. It’s like coming home, a comfort; only the home is coming to me. I will never know such love, such peace, as you. You’re my home.

1. You have been working so hard lately, and I do not want you to think that any of that work goes unnoticed. You are, without a doubt, the most incredible woman I have ever met, and the strength that you have and the challenges you face and defeat every day are honestly awe-inspiring. I hope you never feel unappreciated for all that you do for everyone around you and also us. You truly are the glue that holds everything together, and the world is better off because you are in it.
2. You and I have been together for a long time now, but there has yet to be a day that passes by in which I find myself not thinking about how lucky I am to have you in my life. You are everything I could have ever asked for in a partner. The stars really did align for you and me to be together in the most perfect circumstances. I guess all of the wishings on those stars that I must have done as a kid paid off the first time your eyes met mine and I knew we were destined to be together forever.
3. Whenever you are in a bad place in your life, just remember that you have someone out there who roots for your happiness. That person is me.

5. Anytime I want to tell you how much you mean to me. I find it hard to capture the essence of your value in mere words. Yet, my heart won’t let me rest until I speak out its desire. The best way I can say it is that you are, to me, a diamond discovered in the most unexpected place. Do you know what is done with such a treasure? It is cherished and esteemed above any other item of an endowment. That is how I value you, my priceless jewel.
6. Comparing the before and after years of my life with you, I must confess that I am one of the luckiest gents alive to be in a relationship with a lady with a heart of gold. You don’t even have to believe it; you are too modest to accept that you are special. But that doesn’t stop me from screaming my good luck to the hearing of the whole world.
7. As the dew of the morning, your love brings refreshment to my soul. As the night can’t have enough of the stars, so my life depends on the light of your love to shine. I belong to you, sweetheart.
8. I will have to walk in your shoes as a woman, to understand the weight of your sacrifice to keep our home running. It’s impossible for me to know all that you go through for us. But bear in mind that I am ever grateful to you as my loving wife and the mother of our home. Anything you want, baby, I am ready to do for your happiness.
9. Between you and I, there’s love nestled comfortably, gloriously beaming its light of tender affection on our young hearts, and urging us to stick to the goodness it reveals in us.
10. I am convinced that my achievement so far in life would have been a fairy tale without your unwavering support for my radical dreams. Thanks for all that you have done for me, angel.

From the day you are born, it works 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, right up until you fall in love. Love is when I walk to the other side of the classroom to sharpen my pen so that I can you. Only to realize that I am holding a pen.

## **Long Love Paragraphs For Her To Let Her Know Feelings**

![Long Love Paragraphs For Her To Let Her Know Feelings](images/loveparagraph6.jpg "loveparagraph6")

1. Sometimes when I look at the ocean or an especially large mountain range, I feel overwhelmed and small, but in a good way. It’s comforting to know there’s something out there bigger than I am. Something large and enduring that has lasted through the ages. Through harsh weather, storms and droughts, through changes in history and climate, the ocean keeps on rolling and the mountains keep on standing tall. When I think of you and our love and how I feel about you, I feel the same way. My love for you doesn’t make me feel small though, it makes me feel powerful and new. I look at you and I know that I will love you forever, through storms and droughts, through all the changes that will undoubtedly come our way. I will love you forever. There’s no changing that.
2. If I know one thing for certain, it is this – you always have my back. My best friend, my lover, my secret keeper, and my partner in crime. You are a perfect mix of naughty and nice. You keep things interesting with your mischievous pranks and practical jokes. You always keep me on my toes, wondering what’s next! There is never a dull day with you. Thank you for coming into my life.
3. Just when I had given up on life and love – I met you. You changed everything. I love your innocent and trusting nature. You made me realize that the world is not black or white. They are shades of gray and all the other colors in the rainbow too. I will forever cherish you for bringing sunshine and joy into my life and teaching me to cherish every moment of life. To enjoy early morning sunrises, walks by the beach, or lazy Sunday afternoons instead of chasing intangible things. I love you with every ounce of my soul, forever and ever.
4. You have always been my biggest supporter and fan. You’ve always had my back and in your eyes, I can do nothing wrong, which has built my confidence throughout my life. Thank you, darling, for loving me unconditionally and forever! You have made me the man I am today and I will always love you with all my heart. People say they would love to have a wife that would do anything for her husband. I have that in you and I appreciate all that you do and have always done in my life. You will be the love in my heart for eternity.
5. I never show what you mean to me as often as I should. I am trying to change that. I fall short of words to express what a blessing you have been to me. You have been my constant support through some of the toughest times in life. Your unwavering faith in my abilities and vision is the reason for my success today. You stood behind me and made immense sacrifices for us. You never get enough credit for this. I want you to know you are the reason for everything I have today. Without you, all my success and wealth are meaningless. Now that we have worked so hard for what we always wanted – it is time for us to sit back and enjoy life. Let’s plan a trip around the world and do all the things we missed out on. Will you go on an adventure of a lifetime with me?
6. I wanted to take the time to tell you just how much you mean to me. You’ve become a rock in my life, something solid and secure I can lean on. Knowing you’re by my side makes me so eternally grateful; I can hardly put it into words. I had felt happiness before, but nothing prepared me for the happiness I feel when I’m with you. I don’t know what I said or did that made me lucky enough to deserve you, but I will spend the rest of my life trying to be the best man I can be so that you can be proud. Thank you for all that you do and have done for me. You have taught me what it is to love. You’ve shown me how beautiful life can be.
7. When you feel weak, I am here to be strong for you. When you are strong, I’m here to lift you up and make you stronger. When you are sad, I am here to bring a smile to your face. And when you are happy, I am here to enjoy every minute of it. Because you do all these things for me. When I am weak, you give me strength. When I am sad, you can make me smile every time. I am so grateful for you and our life together. I have found my perfect partner. I am here for you. I will always be here and you will always have my heart.
8. They say the heart wants what it wants and there’s no logic to such things. It’s a little crazy, my love for you. Sometimes it makes me so happy and giddy, it’s like I’m a little boy or on some drug. You make me feel like I can do anything and I am so happy to be with you. Thank you for being the wonderful, amazing person that you are. You surprise me every day and you warm my heart every night. I am the person I am today because you’ve loved me and helped me, love. You are amazing.
9. There are moments when we’re together, when I wish I could make time stop. I often think to myself, that I could easily stay in this moment forever. Just being with you, sitting with you, touching your cheek and stroking your hair. Your head on my shoulder is everything to me. Every moment I spend with you is the best moment of my life. I love you, and I will go on loving you through all the moments we share together from now until forever.
10. I hope you know how much you mean to me. You are such an important part of my life. In fact, you are the center of my life. Everything I do is for us and I hope you know that I am always trying to do the right thing that will make our relationship stronger. You have inspired me to be the best version of myself that I can possibly be and I hope that I can somehow repay you for everything that you have done for me. Without you, I would be a completely different person. You have taught me so much about life and because of you, I truly know what love is.

1. When I first saw you, I was attracted by your beautiful face and charming smile. But it was the beauty of your heart that I fell for. I found an angel in you that is more amazing than what’s visible from the outside.
2. A day that is void of your voice is, to me, an incomplete one. For with your voice comes soul-melting laughter, which is all I need to have a great and happy day. I hope mine makes you feel the same way. Good morning my Cherie.
3. You are the best thing that ever happened in my life. I will forever treasure you. Go the extra mile just to see yourself happy. I will forever be yours. I love you.
4. I realized being in love with you is a life changer and then quickly grabbed the opportunity to become the luckiest guy on earth. In your eyes, I see the great joy that will continue to reign in my life forever. You are my joy, the only true love I have among the world’s ladies. I will never stop loving you for the rest of my life.
5.  Your powerful smile makes me wonder about the kind of person you are because no matter how sad I am, your smile makes me smile.
6. By your side is where I belong. With you, I can break boundaries and make mountains move. There’s so much energy to be drawn from you, sweetheart. Doing life with you is all that makes sense to me. I can’t ask for anything else but your love. I will love you forever.
7. My love for you has no beginning and no end. It is cyclical, like life. It is ever-flowing, like the oceans. It is as boundless as the sky and as vast as the universe. When I see your face, I see my past, my present, my future. When I hold your hand, I feel everything inside of me expand. You are my everything. 
8. I am nothing special; just a common man with common thoughts, and I’ve led a common life. There are no monuments dedicated to me and my name will soon be forgotten. But in one respect, I have succeeded as gloriously as anyone who’s ever lived: I’ve loved another with all my heart and soul; and to me, this has always been enough.
9. Permit me to say that I am completely in love with you. Maybe it took me a while to say it, but I can’t suck it in any longer. My life hasn’t been the same ever since the day I met you. I am greedy, I know. I just want more of you. I want everything about you.
10. You are my opposite. It’s funny the way we are very different yet complement each other perfectly. Our differences don’t keep our love from flowing perfectly. Indeed, you were created to complete me. No other person can do it. I love you with every part of my being.

![Deep Love Paragraphs For Her To Sharing Heartfelt Love](images/loveparagraph8.jpg "loveparagraph8")

1. Everything you do…the way you eat, the way you smile, the way my name rolls off of your tongue…all that is what keeps me going. It gives me so much joy to watch you be you. I would never give my attention to anyone else because I love giving it to you. The day when you were born, it was raining. Actually, it wasn’t raining itself, but heaven was crying for losing the most beautiful angel!
2. Even when we know that nothing in this world is eternal, I know deep down that you and I will live together till eternity. I will love you forever, and I will never fall out of love with you. I am always here to be your lover until the end of time.
3. I thank God for making it possible for us to cross the path right from the beginning because that was where my life gained so much impact on your love.
4. I can create another odyssey describing my love for you. You have such a profound influence on my life that I cannot erase the memories of you even if I live for a million years. I am lucky to be part of your life. I will love you till my last breath!
5. I just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate having you in my life. For helping me through the bad times and being there to help me celebrate the good times, I cherish all of the moments that we share together. There aren’t enough words in the dictionary for me to tell you how glad I am to have you in my life. I am so lucky to have you by my side. Everything you do for me never goes unnoticed.
6. Life offers many choices to make, but loving you is the only thing I wish to do. I want to spend my entire existence showing you how much you have impacted my life. Hand-in-hand, I will prove to you that my life is better with you in it. For the sake of your love, I am ready to face whatever it takes to make you smile at all times. I will love you until I am no more because your love is my greatest wealth.
7. Love is not something that you can express in words. Love is something that is expressed by actions and felt with the heart. I don’t know how much loved I make you feel but trust me, dear, you are the most precious thing in my life. I love you!
8. My most beloved woman. Without you, I do not exist. I need you and you alone to survive the storms of life. You are such a perfect woman for me. I could barely meet someone better than you. You’re the meaning of a great experience, and I can’t love you less.
9. My world feels dark when you’re not here. Even when I’m out under a cloudless sky, it feels like there’s a haze over everything. Before you, the world was filled with so many lights, streetlights, stars, the moon, and the sun. Now it feels like you are the brightest light in my life. It would explain why I feel so warm around you, how you provide me with the energy and the strength to persevere through my darkest hours. You also shine brilliantly enough that I know I’ll always be able to find my way back to you.
10. One paragraph is not enough for me to tell you just how much you mean to me. It would take me thousands of pages to tell you just how much I love you. If I spent the rest of eternity writing, I still would not accurately portray how amazing you are and all of the reasons why I love you.

## **Emotional love paragraphs for her to rekindle the love**

1. In love alphabets, ‘U’ and ‘I’ were placed close to each other because Without U (You), I (am) nothing. I find my purpose in your sight, and I exist for your love forever.
2. I have for the first time found what I can truly love—I have found you. You are my sympathy—my better self—my good angel; I am bound to you with a strong attachment. I think you are good, gifted, lovely: a fervent, a solemn passion is conceived in my heart; it leans to you, draws you to my center and spring of life, wraps my existence about you—and, kindling in pure, powerful flame, fuses you and me in one. 
3. You are my strength. You are not only the sails that steer my ship, but you are also the waves below that carry me. Without you, I would cease to have a backbone, as you are the entire foundation holding me up. I could never think of a day where you are not with me. I imagine if that day came, I would become weak. I would crumble into a coward. But together, we are strong. We are unstoppable. That is why I love you.
4. Sweetheart, I wanted to write you a love letter. I know it’s a little silly but I thought I’d try anyway. It’s just that I feel so much when I’m with you that I try to put it in words, so that you know how I feel about you. You are such a gift to me. Having you in my life is such a blessing.
5. You are my happiness, my heart desire, my everlasting flame, the one that makes my heart beat fast. My love, my queen, I cannot think for a second without you in my mind. I cherish you, princess of beauty.
6. Whenever I’m with you, I’m different but in a good way. I smile and laugh more, and I don’t have to pretend that everything is okay. With you, I can drop the facade and just feel and express everything genuinely. I no longer feel hurt and alone; and instead, I feel safe and loved. You’re so easy to talk to, to open up to. And in turn, everything you say resonates with me like no other. You have shown me that there is one person who can love me for who I am in this world filled with apathy. I appreciate you being here because, with you, I’m different. With you, I’m happy.
7. They say pictures are worth a thousand words, but I can only say three words when I look at your picture: I love you.
8. A girl like you with a heart of gold deserves all the good things in this life, and I am prepared to go the extra mile to see you have these in your life; I know you would do the same for me even more, that’s a fact. When I look into your eyes, I am connected to your soul; all I see is profound love. I see a reminder of why I must work hard to give you everything you will ever need. You have made me a complete person. Thank you, my love.
9. You have always been my biggest supporter and fan. You’ve always had my back, and in your eyes, I can do nothing wrong, which has built my confidence throughout my life. Thank you, darling, for loving me unconditionally and forever! You have made me the man I am today, and I will always love you with all my heart. People say they would love to have a wife that would do anything for her husband. I have that in you, and I appreciate everything you do and have always done in my life. You will be the love in my heart to eternity.
10. I just wanted to take this opportunity to say thank you. Thank you for everything you’ve done for me. Thank you for loving me and accepting me unconditionally and providing me with undivided love and attention. You’ve been there for me through everything. Thank you for helping me grow into the man I have become.

3. Monday blues? Nope! They’re a myth. Every day is a weekend when you are around. I wake up each morning looking forward to being next to you, holding your hands, and listening to your laughter and unending stories.
4. I wish I were whispering sweet things to your ears and tickling you right now rather than writing you this paragraph. I love you, babe, and I miss the love moments with you. Have a lovely day with your pals.
5. I never believed in soulmates until I met you, honey. Every word and action of yours makes me believe that God had created you to be with me. Let’s make this time we have on Earth a fruitful one. Have a blessed morning and a fantastic day.
6. I am undoubtedly your biggest fan and cheerleader. And I promise never to stop loving you. Good Morning, my baby doll!
7. You are the light of my heart, the joy of my life, and the first thought on my mind. Good Morning, my darling!
8. The mere thought of being with you brightens up my morning. Good Morning, my lady!
9. When you get this sweet kiss, do not forget to send me one back immediately. Have a beautiful morning, my love!
10. My heart skips a beat every time I see your perfect smile. Hoping that you will send me a selfie to show your charming smile. Good Morning, my beautiful girl!
