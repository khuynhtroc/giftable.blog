Mothers nowadays are obsessed with time management. With children’s activities, [home duties](https://avada.io/loveable/home-organization-ideas/), and, for many, the pressures of a demanding career, many women have given up the attempt to make time for themselves and are just rushing to get everything done. 

The ideas about **time management for working moms** below may be utilized by busy parents everywhere to [relieve stress](https://avada.io/loveable/stress-relief-gifts/) and make more time for fun moments with their children, meaningful time with their husbands, or even that treasured and nearly forgotten alone time.

## 1\. Sleep Enough

Even though it might be challenging for a busy mother to obtain a decent night’s sleep, it is still crucial! Your health depends on getting enough sleep, and it also improves your mood and may even make you a better mother. These are some simple tips you may take to give yourself the priority of having an excellent night’s sleep.

![Your health depends on getting enough sleep](images/time-management-for-working-moms-2.jpg "time-management-for-working-moms-2")

Your health depends on getting enough sleep

- Make a sleeping area

Make your bedroom a place you look forward to coming back to at the end of the working day and sleeping in. You should use bedding and pillows that make you joyful and comfy. You may also listen to peaceful music or use calming oils in a diffuser near your bed.

- Reduce the brightness of the lights

Dimming the lights an hour or two before bedtime helps your body understand that sleep is approaching.

- Avoid using electronic devices before going to bed

For at least an hour before going to bed, turn off your phone, computer, and television. This is a challenge because most of us like unwinding with a television show or catching up on social media. But try skipping the last hour of screen time for a week and see how it helps!

- Caffeine should be avoided.

To get a better night’s sleep, avoid coffee in the afternoon and evening.

- Exercise

A wonderful method to get your body ready to wind down and sleep is to be active. Try going for a family stroll each night after supper. It’s a terrific opportunity to interact with others while also benefiting your health and sleep.

- Set up a nighttime schedule.

A nighttime routine is beneficial for everyone, not just kids. Your body is signaled to prepare for sleep by a nighttime practice. Even before you get into bed, it will assist your body in starting the sleep cycle.

## 2\. Healthy Eating 

Here are a few more culinary ideas that can boost your confidence in the kitchen and help you get food on the table faster!

![Healthy Eating](images/time-management-for-working-moms-3.jpg "time-management-for-working-moms-3")

Healthy Eating

- Equip your kitchen with a slow cooker or an instant pot.

These kitchen tools will make it easier to prepare for your family!

A crockpot is a terrific alternative for feeding your family since you can set it and forget it. Throw everything together and set it aside while you drive the kids to sports practice or cheer them on at the big game. As you walk through the door, a delicious and appetizing supper will be waiting for you.

- Preparing food in bulk

Batch cooking is simply preparing recipes ahead of time. It is an excellent technique to save time while feeding your family because you are preparing numerous meals ahead of time.

You may cook many meals at once and freeze them. This strategy can help you save time and energy on busy days by reducing [cleaning](https://avada.io/loveable/cleaning-gifts/) down to a single cleanup for numerous meals.

- To make cooking less stressful, clean as you go.

This trick of cleaning will save you a lot of time! Put old dishes into a sink of soapy water or directly into the dishwasher to avoid them piling up on the counter and getting in your way.

- Use a recipe or device stand

Create a specific area near your workspace for reading recipes, whether from a cookbook or on your tablet; this way, you’re not continuously moving them or traveling to the opposite side of the kitchen to check the recipe.

## 3\. Prioritize Tasks to Get More Done

Take some time to create a master list of all your tasks. It might become fairly lengthy, especially if you begin to include items that must be accomplished once a year or quarterly.

During this time, concentrate on the monthly, weekly, and daily chores that must be finished. These are your primary worries.

When you commit to an activity or chore, it must contribute to one of your family’s goals in some manner and must fit into the time window that you have available. Remember, even if you are a working mom, you only have 24 hours in a day!

![Remember, even if you are a working mom, you only have 24 hours in a day!](images/time-management-for-working-moms-4.jpg "time-management-for-working-moms-4")

Remember, even if you are a working mom, you only have 24 hours in a day!

Moreover, it is critical to distinguish between urgent and important jobs. These are not the same thing, and you must differentiate between the two while establishing your weekly and daily priorities.

An urgent task is one that must be done within a short period of time. These might be looming deadlines or tasks that must be completed before moving on to anything else.

Crucial tasks are those that help you achieve your objectives. They help us achieve our short- and long-term objectives, missions, and values. Important tasks can occasionally be urgent, but not always.

Once you’ve determined which activities are urgent, you must assign a value to each of the remaining tasks and assess how long each one will take to accomplish. Because there are only so many hours in the day, we can only stack so much.

Each activity’s worth is decided by its contribution to your objectives or family life, and completion time is how long you anticipate each work will take.

## 4\. Create a Schedule

When it comes to time management for working moms, incorporate some of these productivity hacks into your regular routine. Keep track of what works and what doesn’t so you can develop a long-term plan to boost your productivity.

![Incorporate some of these productivity hacks into your regular routine](images/time-management-for-working-moms-5.jpg "time-management-for-working-moms-5")

Incorporate some of these productivity hacks into your regular routine

- Put an end to multitasking

It’s easy to try to multitask by juggling many work-related tasks at once. Even while it could seem useful, this rarely results in the best effects. Instead, focusing on one task at a time can help you do it more quickly and with higher quality. This will make it easier for you to go on to the next task and complete the whole working day more effectively.

- Establish minor objectives

Big jobs or projects can be scary, and we frequently underestimate how long it will take to finish them. Breaking work down into manageable, bite-sized milestones that develop until your project is complete might help you gain forward momentum.

- Take a rest.

It may seem counterintuitive to advocate taking pauses when discussing how to be more productive at work, yet frequent breaks can reduce stress and enhance productivity.

- The rule of five minutes

If you struggle with procrastination, try the five-minute rule. Many of the obstacles to starting are removed when you try to persuade yourself that you will only work on that unfinished job for five minutes. Virtually everybody can devote five minutes to sending an email, researching a topic, filing, or planning new work.

- Blocking time

Utilizing time blocks is a tried-and-true productivity method. By including time block frames in your weekday calendar, you make an intentional decision to devote a ‘block’ of time to a specific job.

## 5\. Identify Time Wasters

It is critical to recognize typical time wasters at home and how mothers might overcome them to contribute to time management for working moms. These are some examples of frequent time wasters to keep an eye out for in your life. Since if we work effectively, we can achieve faster and teach our adolescents excellent time management skills as well! And we construct a joyful and satisfying lifestyle!

It is critical to recognize typical time wasters at home

### Making too many options

You already have too many decisions if you have to decide what to make for breakfast, what to dress, who is in charge of what duties, and what to cook for dinner every day.

The more your home can be automated, the less time will be lost. And the more power you’ll have to make decisions that really count!

Here are some ideas to get you started. Decide what meals you’ll cook and what duties you’ll strive to finish each day at the start of the week. You can also establish a schedule in which you have particular meals on specific days of the week.

### Postponing little decisions

While it is important to stay focused on the current work, it is frequently more beneficial to do those quick things right away.

You may be cooking supper or folding clothes when your spouse comes with the mail. It is preferable to swiftly sort through the mail, putting the bills in your bill folder and tossing away the advertisements. If you leave it, the stack of mail will likely be moved around a lot before you get a chance to sort it.

A typical time waster is touching and moving an object repeatedly before making a decision, therefore try to make minor options as rapidly as possible.

### Absence of a to-do list

Making a to-do list or keeping a calendar filled out may really help you with time management for working moms. You have a far better understanding of the chores or activities you can combine together when you can see everything put out. 

You’ll be more aware of how much time you have available to do things. Also, setting tasks in writing helps you focus and avoid wasting time.

## 6\. Time-Saving Strategies 

Continue reading for some easy adjustments you can make to become more productive around the house and succeed in time management for working moms.

![Time-Saving Strategies](images/time-management-for-working-moms-9.jpg "time-management-for-working-moms-9")

Time-Saving Strategies

- Prepare for the following morning the night before.

The next day’s breakfast, lunch, bags, coursework, and other items can all be prepared. If you implement and frequently adhere to this routine, mornings will go a lot more smoothly.

- Set up automatic bill payment

You will save a ton of time every month after you have your recurring payments set up for your bills. Where feasible, choose electronic statements to avoid having the extra paper delivered to your home and having to organize it.

- Buy online

It is inefficient to spend time traveling to several stores in search of what you need or desire, particularly if you are accompanied by small children. If you haven’t already, sign up for Amazon Prime to have your purchases delivered right to your door.

- Each entryway should have a mat.

Keep it out to ensure that less dirt enters the house to be cleaned! By installing a doormat at each entry, you will reduce the frequency with which you must sweep or vacuum.

- Organize Your Silverware

Place each type of utensil in its own slot when you load the dishwasher. Spoons should be used with spoons, forks with forks, and so on. This method saves a significant amount of time while emptying. This is one that the children will undoubtedly like.

- Let children assist with housework and cleaning.

There is no way you can do everything. From an early age, children are capable of assisting around the house. Make a chore chart and get everyone involved. According to research, giving children housework chores increases their self-esteem.
