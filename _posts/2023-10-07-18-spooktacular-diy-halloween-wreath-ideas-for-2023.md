### **1\. DIY Crow Wreath Halloween** 

![DIY Halloween Wreath](images/diy-halloween-wreath-1.jpg "diy-halloween-wreath-1")

Crows land on a spooky grapevine wreath that has been painted black.

**To create this wreath:** Begin by spraying a grapevine wreath with black paint. Let it dry completely. Use hot glue to attach small wooden scarecrows to the wreath (if preferred, you can also cut them out of cardboard and paint them black). Finally, thread a piece of striped or grosgrain ribbon through the wreath to hang it up.

### **2\. DIY Halloween Black Magic Vintage Frame**

![DIY Halloween Wreath](images/diy-halloween-wreath-2.jpg "diy-halloween-wreath-2")

This craft project is delightfully spooky. We suggest hanging it in a covered area to keep it safe from the weather.

**To create this piece:** Begin by removing the glass from a vintage frame, preferably one with intricate designs. Give the surface a light sanding, then spray paint it black and let it dry.

Next, cut a piece of ribbon and use hot glue to stick it to the back of the frame, forming a hanger. If the frame is heavy, you can use a staple gun or traditional picture hanging wire for extra support. Cut the other length of ribbon and tie a bow in the middle of the hanger.

Now, download and print [the “Beware!” calligraphy clip art](https://hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/files/gh-halloween-calligraphy-1597083228.pdf) onto cardstock. You can choose to frame the lettering or make a simple paper scroll by rolling the paper and securing it with glue. Additionally, download and print the Halloween bug images onto cardstock. Cut them out, fold them at the joints to give them dimension, and then glue them onto the frame.

### **3\. DIY Creepy Crawly Spider Web Wreath**

![DIY Halloween Wreath](images/diy-halloween-wreath-3.jpg "diy-halloween-wreath-3")

Create a spooky spider web this Halloween by using a mason jar lid, some chopsticks, and cotton string. Prepare to give your space an extra creepy touch!

**Tutorials:** To begin, spray paint the metal lid from a large-mouth canning jar with black paint. Also, spray paint a handful of plastic bugs in any color you prefer. Once dry, grab 12 black chopsticks and evenly space them on the metal lid. Use a huge amount of hot glue to secure them in place, and let them dry completely.

Now, take a 17-inch length of cotton rope or string. Wrap it around each chopstick once, moving on to the next until you’ve wrapped all the chopsticks. To secure the end, apply hot glue where you began and trim off any excess rope. Repeat this process using a new length of rope that’s about five inches longer than the previous one. Wrap it around the chopsticks, creating another circle of rope about an inch-and-a-half away from the previous circle. Keep repeating this step until you reach the end of the chopsticks. For an extra eerie touch, use hot glue to attach your painted bugs in the center of the web, as well as a few spiders on the outside.

### **4\. Plaid Fall Wreath DIY** 

![DIY Halloween Wreath](images/diy-halloween-wreath-4.jpg "diy-halloween-wreath-4")

Plaid shirts and autumn leaves are the perfect combination, just like Thanksgiving and turkey! We adore the idea of celebrating these fall essentials with a joyful wreath that brings them together.

**Let’s make the wreath:** Start by tracing leaf stencils onto double-stick fusible webbing. Fuse the webbing into plaid fabric and carefully cut out the leaf shapes. Next, fuse the cut out leaves into felt and cut them out once again. Now, take a foam wreath form and wrap it with ribbon. To attach the leaves, you can use push-pins or hot glue, mixing both the plaid and felt sides for a delightful contrast. Finally, hang the wreath with a strip of plaid fabric.

This charming wreath will beautifully capture the essence of fall, combining the warmth of plaid and the natural beauty of autumn leaves. Get ready to add a spooky touch to your home with this delightful creation!

### **5\. DIY Colorful Corn Husk Wreath**

![DIY Halloween Wreath](images/diy-halloween-wreath-5.jpg "diy-halloween-wreath-5")

Create a stunning autumn wreath effortlessly using corn husks and liquid fabric dye. Crafting this eye-catching fall wreath is a breeze. Simply gather corn husks and liquid fabric dye, and let your creativity shine.

### **6\. Black Ribbon Halloween Wreath DIY** 

![DIY Halloween Wreath](images/diy-halloween-wreath-6.jpg "diy-halloween-wreath-6")

Who says an all-black wreath is off-limits? On Halloween, we’re ready to embrace the unconventional! This bewitching craft may not give off a warm welcome, but it’s sure to captivate every trick-or-treater in town.

**Let’s get started on making this spellbinding wreath:** Begin by cutting 150 strips of black grosgrain ribbon, each measuring 6 inches in length and 2 inches in width. Fold each strip in half and attach them to a 16-inch foam wreath form using straight pins. Layer them on top of each other to create a beautifully ruffled effect.

Next, cut out a witch silhouette from black kraft paper. Take a 16-inch round piece of clear acrylic and affix the witch silhouette to its center using double-sided tape. Carefully hot-glue the edges of the acrylic round to the back of the wreath form, securing it firmly in place. To add a final touch, tie a bow with long tails and incorporate it into the wreath design.

### **7\. DIY Halloween Candy Wreath**

![DIY Halloween Wreath](images/diy-halloween-wreath-7.jpg "diy-halloween-wreath-7")

Bringing retro candy to your front door adds a delightful touch of nostalgia. The only hurdle? Resisting the temptation to snack on them before you start crafting!

**Let’s dive into making this sweet wreath:** Start by gathering an assortment of old-fashioned candies in vibrant autumnal hues like yellow, orange, and magenta. Take a 14-inch foam wreath form and wrap it snugly with white ribbon. Using hot glue, attach the candies to the wreath, layering and overlapping them as you go to create an eye-catching arrangement. Finally, add a finishing touch with a yellow burlap bow.

Prepare to welcome guests with a charming wreath that not only showcases retro candy but also evokes a sense of whimsy and joy. Just remember to resist the temptation to indulge in those sweet treats until after you’ve completed your craft!

### **8\. Spider Halloween Wreath Handmade** 

![DIY Halloween Wreath](images/diy-halloween-wreath-8.jpg "diy-halloween-wreath-8")

Create an elegant yet spooky ambiance with an all-white wreath adorned with tiny faux spiders.

**Let’s get started on crafting this enchanting piece:** Begin by tying six pieces of white string across a 14-inch foam wreath form. Make sure to loop each string at the midway point of the first piece attached, forming a central point. This will serve as the base of the web and should have 12 “spokes.” Next, tie a long piece of string to the center point and start weaving and looping it from the center outwards to create the intricate web pattern. If you run out of string, simply tie the other piece to the end and continue weaving. When you reach the nice wreath form, tie off the string at your desired ending point. For an added touch of authenticity, move the twine up and down to create some uneven gaps in the web.

Next, wrap the wreath form with white burlap ribbon, ensuring it is fully covered, and secure it in place. Use hot glue to attach the faux spiders to the edges of the wreath, adding a subtle yet eerie touch. Finally, loop a piece of white burlap ribbon around the form to serve as a hanger.

### **9\. DIY Wreath: Ribbon Ties & String Ghost**
