- You really need privacy 
- Nightmares often occur when you feel uncomfortable going to bed, maybe because of wearing too thick clothes or too tight sleeping space.

## Dream Of Being Robbed: Spiritual Explanation 

Some dreams about being robbed are a good sign, but others are not. No matter what, you have these dreams so that you can do something about your life. 

On the one hand, dreaming of being robbed is a spiritual sign that you feel helpless or unhappy in some part of your life. It could also be a warning to trust your gut and stay away from bad people. 

On the other hand, some old ways of interpreting dreams say that if you dream that you are a thief or the victim of a robbery, you will soon meet a cruel person who will get in the way of your happiness.

If you have these dreams, it’s a sign that you might lose your things soon. It’s also possible that your dreams show how tense and unhappy you were during the day. People often feel helpless and like something bad is about to happen when they have these dreams. (some problem as I mentioned in above part). If you feel emotionally or materially cheated out of your daily life, you may have dreams about robbing other people. That which lies ahead is more difficult than you can handle right now, both in terms of suffering and danger.

It’s important to keep in mind that this dream is a metaphor for overcoming adversity and emerging stronger on the other side.

## Bottom line

Sometimes they remind you to pay attention to your physical and emotional safety. When you **dream of being robbed**, it reminds you that you have a special duty to protect the people you care about. They might be trying to tell you that you haven’t paid enough attention to some parts of your life.
