## **Best Christmas Songs to Get You in the Holiday Spirit**

### **[1\. ‘The Christmas Song’ by Nat King Cole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKhRnZZ0cJI)**

In the sweltering summer of 1945, Bob Wells and Mel Tormé crafted this song as a way to “stay cool by thinking cool,” giving birth to the most-performed Christmas song.

![best christmas songs](images/best-christmas-songs-1.jpg "best-christmas-songs-1")

### **[2\. ‘All I Want For Christmas Is You’ by Mariah Carey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAkMkVFwAoo&pp=ygU0Mi4gJ0FsbCBJIFdhbnQgRm9yIENocmlzdG1hcyBJcyBZb3UnIGJ5IE1hcmlhaCBDYXJleQ%3D%3D)**

It’s almost unbelievable that ‘All I Want For Christmas Is You’ by Mariah Carey was once a forgotten novelty song on a typical pop-singer holiday album. However, in the post Love Actually era, its return every year has become a surefire signal that the holiday season has arrived. Although it initially came and went in 1995, the song steadily gained cultural cachet in the following years, rising in popularity until it finally conquered the US charts in 2019 and the UK charts in 2020.

Despite some complaining about its frequent play, the song’s undeniable appeal remains intact. From the enchanting twinkling intro to Mariah’s exceptional delivery, ‘All I Want For Christmas Is You’ stands the test of time, flawlessly capturing the spirit of the season. So, while a few may grumble, the rest of us revel in its timeless magic, as it fills our hearts with joy and holiday cheer year after year.

### **[3\. ‘Last Christmas’ by Wham!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8gmARGvPlI&pp=ygUgMy4g4oCYTGFzdCBDaHJpc3RtYXPigJkgYnkgV2hhbSE%3D)**

A tale of romance doomed to fade away, ‘Last Christmas’ envelops listeners with its sleighbells and synths, while the music video showcases unforgettable knitwear.

However, what truly distinguishes ‘Last Christmas’ is George Michael’s emotionally charged performance, wearing his heart on his sleeve. His genuine heartbreak and wistful, alluring whispers leave a lasting impact, transforming the simple words ‘Merry Christmas’ into something profoundly sultry.

![best christmas songs](images/best-christmas-songs-2.jpg "best-christmas-songs-2")

### **[4\. ‘Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)’ by Darlene Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vf4ZXBzbAio&pp=ygU6NC4g4oCYQ2hyaXN0bWFzIChCYWJ5IFBsZWFzZSBDb21lIEhvbWUp4oCZIGJ5IERhcmxlbmUgTG92ZQ%3D%3D)**

Could this be the most heartwarming Christmas melody ever? Highly likely. Darlene Love’s flawless and soulful vocals, coupled with Phil Spector’s resplendent and festive production, and the enchanting songwriting of Ellie Greenwich and Jeff Barry, create a magical masterpiece that can thaw even the coldest hearts. It’s an absolutely perfect Christmas song that captures the true essence of the season.

### **[5\. ‘Stay Another Day’ by East 17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wNhdjoF-6M&pp=ygUkNS4g4oCYU3RheSBBbm90aGVyIERheeKAmSBieSBFYXN0IDE3)**

East 17’s timeless Christmas classic was never intended to be a Christmas song in the first place. According to Tony Mortimer, the group’s songwriter, it originated from a place of profound sadness, inspired by his brother’s tragic suicide. That raw emotion finds its way into the group’s beautifully melancholic four-part harmonies, even amidst the customary Christmas song sleigh bells, creating a matchless display of festive melancholy.

### **[6\. ‘White Christmas’ by Bing Crosby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5ryZdpEHqM&pp=ygUnNi4g4oCYV2hpdGUgQ2hyaXN0bWFz4oCZIGJ5IEJpbmcgQ3Jvc2J5)**

The potency of Christmas nostalgia surpasses even our actual memories. Thus, through Bing Crosby’s rendition of this Irving Berlin-penned ’40s song, we can all reminisce about white Christmases reminiscent of the ones we once knew, regardless of any real-life disappointments we might have experienced in the past (like that December 25, 1993 without the anticipated Hornby train set).

![best christmas songs](images/best-christmas-songs-4.jpg "best-christmas-songs-4")

### **[7\. ‘Fairytale of New York’ by The Pogues and Kirsty MacColl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9jbdgZidu8&pp=ygU_Ny4g4oCYRmFpcnl0YWxlIG9mIE5ldyBZb3Jr4oCZIGJ5IFRoZSBQb2d1ZXMgYW5kIEtpcnN0eSBNYWNDb2xs)**

Have you truly immersed yourself in Kirsty MacColl and The Pogues’ magnificent tale set in the Big Apple? Close your eyes and let the music guide you through this epic narrative. If you don’t find yourself emotionally moved by the fade-out, your heart (much like that cherished jumper from your nan) may be a tad too small. 

‘Fairytale of New York’ is an impeccable four-minute journey encompassing hope, despair, and heartbreak, all culminating in a message of love, despite the profanity.

### **[8\. ‘Do They Know It’s Christmas?’ by Band Aid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3fSknbR7Y4)**

Bob Geldof and Midge Ure’s response to the Ethiopian famine in 1984, joined by contributions from Phil Collins, Sting, Paul McCartney, and Bono, became an extraordinary publicity machine. 

Their effort proved successful, as ‘Do They Know It’s Christmas?’ remained at the top of the charts for an impressive five weeks, making it the most significant UK chart success of the decade. Setting aside its impactful purpose, the song itself is undeniably a great and refreshingly unconventional pop tune, snow-related meteorological inaccuracies notwithstanding.

![best christmas songs](images/best-christmas-songs-3.jpg "best-christmas-songs-3")

### **[9\. ‘Sleigh Ride’ by The Ronettes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkXIJe8CaIc&pp=ygUkOS4g4oCYU2xlaWdoIFJpZGXigJkgYnkgVGhlIFJvbmV0dGVz)**

Ronnie Spector’s distinctively sensual vocals possess the power to thaw even the coldest Christmas snow. In this standout track from the classic Phil Spector Christmas album, among the best Christmas songs, she purrs about snuggling cozily under a blanket during a sleigh ride, accompanied by the delightful ‘ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding’ of her fellow Ronettes in the background. 

While Spector’s arrangement features trilling bells and clip-clopping hooves, the melody exudes an irresistible warmth, hinting at the interesting fact that this song, composed by the light orchestral maestro Leroy Anderson, was born during a sweltering July heatwave.

### **[10\. ‘Christmas Wrapping’ by The Waitresses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nud2TQNahaU&pp=ygUqMTAuICdDaHJpc3RtYXMgV3JhcHBpbmcnIGJ5IFRoZSBXYWl0cmVzc2Vz)**

Told from the viewpoint of a busy single woman, this often overlooked song portrays her attempt to avoid getting swept up in the draining holiday season while also contemplating the possibility of going on a date with a man she met earlier in the year.

Songwriter Chris Butler penned the lyrics during a taxi ride to the recording studio. He revealed that the idea stemmed from his personal experience, as he once despised Christmas due to the frantic hustle and bustle among his peers in New York. It seemed less about joy and more about coping with the chaos.

![best christmas songs](images/best-christmas-songs-5.jpg "best-christmas-songs-5")

### **[11\. ‘Driving Home for Christmas’ by Chris Rea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDt3u2Ev1cI&pp=ygUxMTEuIOKAmERyaXZpbmcgSG9tZSBmb3IgQ2hyaXN0bWFz4oCZIGJ5IENocmlzIFJlYQ%3D%3D)**

Among the best Christmas songs, the lounge-inspired tune depicting the plight of Christmas traffic, delivered by the husky-voiced favorite, Chris Rea, has remarkably stood the test of time. Its enduring appeal is evident through two UK chart appearances, reaching 53 in 1988 and 33 in 2007. 

Moreover, it even achieved the impressive feat of cracking Norway’s Top Three a few years back. Clearly, this harmless slice of Christmas cheese transcends generations and nationalities, resonating with people from all walks of life who delight in its festive charm.

### **[12\. ‘Christmas in Hollis’ by Run-DMC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OR07r0ZMFb8&pp=ygUoMTIuIOKAmENocmlzdG1hcyBpbiBIb2xsaXPigJkgYnkgUnVuLURNQw%3D%3D)**

Undoubtedly one of the most famous and finest Christmas hip-hop tracks, Run DMC’s clever Crimbo tale unfolds as Run stumbles upon Santa’s wallet, brimming with bills, in the park on Christmas Eve. In a fine display of festive spirit, Run declares, ‘But I’d never steal from Santa, ’cause that ain’t right.’ 

The result is an irresistibly catchy tune that offers a delightful break from the usual Slade and Macca classics, or simply too many mince pies, injecting a dose of lively energy when you’re feeling a bit flat.

### **[13\. ‘’tis the damn season’ by Taylor Swift](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuvhOD-mP8M)**

Among the various remnants of Taylor Swift’s pre-pop era is a Christmas album that, hopefully, won’t undergo re-recording like Red and Fearless. None of the tracks from The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection come close to matching the brilliance of ’tis the damn season’ from her post-folklore and post-capitalization album evermore. 

In true storyteller fashion, the song sees the singer spending the holidays at her parents’ house, indulging in nostalgia for the small-town sights and familiar connections. It may not have the same belting energy as ‘jingle bell rock,’ but it might just inspire you to reach out to your high-school crush for a leisurely stroll when you’re feeling a bit bored.

![best christmas songs](images/best-christmas-songs-7.jpg "best-christmas-songs-7")

### **[14\. ‘Santa Tell Me’ by Ariana Grande](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlR0MkrRklg&pp=ygUoMTQuIOKAmFNhbnRhIFRlbGwgTWXigJkgYnkgQXJpYW5hIEdyYW5kZQ%3D%3D)**

Although Ariana Grande didn’t quite reach the level of a Mariah Carey megahit with this cheery and upbeat celebration of joy, she came remarkably close, rivaling almost any other pop star in the past 30-ish years since ‘All I Want for Christmas Is You.’ 

Unlike Kelly Clarkson, who achieved success channeling Darlene Love, Ariana’s song seamlessly blends into her catalog of lively tunes, allowing for a smooth transition between this festive plea to St. Nick and her recent hit about a late-night tantra session.

### **[15\. ‘O Come, O Come, Emmanuel’ by Sufjan Stevens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cppww7NoOYM)**

When it comes to the best Christmas songs, Sufjan Stevens is in a league of his own. In 1996, he treated us to a remarkable 42-track album titled “Songs For Christmas,” and this year, he outdid himself with “Silver & Gold” – an astounding 101-song collection celebrating the birth of Jesus. 

With such an impressive festive back catalog, choosing a favorite is no easy task, but ‘O Come O Come Emmanuel’ holds a special place in our hearts. This reimagining of the traditional favorite on ‘Songs For Christmas’ is a masterpiece – sparse and haunting, yet undeniably uplifting. A beautiful call to rejoice that captures the true essence of the season.

![best christmas songs](images/best-christmas-songs-6.jpg "best-christmas-songs-6")

### **[16\. ‘Zat You, Santa Claus?’ by Louis Armstrong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqIpxPvhb_8&pp=ygUyMTYuIOKAmFphdCBZb3UsIFNhbnRhIENsYXVzP-KAmSBieSBMb3VpcyBBcm1zdHJvbmc%3D)**

Even with the legendary jazz musician behind it, this Christmas song maintains a surprisingly modest presence when the holiday tunes start playing. It might not have created a huge sensation for Louis Armstrong either, but you know what? 

It’s all about him having a blast, evident in the cheerful and playful lyrics, complemented by the lively trumpet lines that drive the song. After all, Christmas should be about fun and joy. Kudos to you, Louis, and let’s hope Santa delivers that delightfully pleasant present you’ve requested right to your door.

### **[17\. ‘I Wish It Was Christmas Today’ by Julian Casablancas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wS-k66MKgs&pp=ygU9MTcuIOKAmEkgV2lzaCBJdCBXYXMgQ2hyaXN0bWFzIFRvZGF54oCZIGJ5IEp1bGlhbiBDYXNhYmxhbmNhcw%3D%3D)**

Originally a ‘Saturday Night Live’ creation in 2000, ‘I Wish It Was Christmas Today’ was written by Jimmy Fallon and Horatio Sanz, becoming a recurring piece on the long-standing US comedy show throughout the ’00s. However, it has now been forever defined by a tremendous rendition from Strokes frontman Julian Casablancas.

 In this version, he seamlessly blends the song’s bratty demand for an immediate Christmas with his band’s signature raw and nonchalant new wave style. It might have garnered more recognition if its origin had been a bit less convoluted. Nonetheless, it remains a standout as the last great indie Christmas song, leaving a lasting impression on listeners with its unique charm.

![best christmas songs](images/best-christmas-songs-8.jpg "best-christmas-songs-8")

### **[18\. ‘Underneath the Tree’ by Kelly Clarkson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM2Fnp_qnE8&pp=ygUvMTguIOKAmFVuZGVybmVhdGggdGhlIFRyZWXigJkgYnkgS2VsbHkgQ2xhcmtzb24%3D)**

Undoubtedly, Kelly Clarkson’s venture into festive music seems like a brazen attempt to combine the magic of ‘All I Want for Christmas Is You’ and Darlene Love’s ‘Christmas (Baby Please Come Home).’ 

Surprisingly, it manages to pull it off with style. The songwriting strikes the perfect balance between sentimental charm and Spector-style sass, making it work. However, the real magic lies in Clarkson’s superb vocal performance, which exudes a contagious sincerity that captivates listeners. And that high note towards the end? It’s an unforgettable moment that adds the perfect touch of holiday enchantment.

### **[19\. ‘Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree’ by Brenda Lee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSHGd4lmLd4&pp=ygU7MTkuIOKAmFJvY2tpbuKAmSBBcm91bmQgdGhlIENocmlzdG1hcyBUcmVl4oCZIGJ5IEJyZW5kYSBMZWU%3D)**

Defying expectations, another timeless Christmas favorite sprang from the seemingly transient rockabilly craze of the ’50s. At just thirteen years old, singer Brenda Lee couldn’t fathom why songwriter Johnny Marks chose her to deliver this song. 

Nevertheless, well over 60 years later, it stands as a delightful and lively classic, epitomizing unjaded enthusiasm for the holiday season. Lee’s joyful yelps express her excitement for a seasonal boogie, and the song continues to spread its sweet, sprightly charm.

![best christmas songs](images/best-christmas-songs-9.jpg "best-christmas-songs-9")

### **[20\. ‘Christmas at Ground Zero’ by ‘Weird Al’ Yankovic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t039p6xqutU&pp=ygU9MjAuIOKAmENocmlzdG1hcyBhdCBHcm91bmQgWmVyb-KAmSBieSDigJhXZWlyZCBBbOKAmSBZYW5rb3ZpYw%3D%3D)**

Amidst the threat of nuclear annihilation, only Al Yankovic could manage to find Christmas cheer. Al recorded this early hit, employing Phil Spector’s renowned ‘wall of sound’ production to recreate the magic of Darlene Love and Ronettes classics – and boy, did it work! 

Al’s jaunty song, with air-raid sirens harmonizing alongside jingle bells, exudes an authentic charm despite his vintage Cold War paranoia and references to nuclear mutants roaming the Earth. In fact, it conjures a compelling vision of an Omega Man holiday special, showcasing Al Yankovic’s unique ability to blend humor and festivity even amidst dark and uncertain times.

### **[21\. ‘River’ by Joni Mitchell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLHxxBTl71I&pp=ygUgMjEuIOKAmFJpdmVy4oCZIGJ5IEpvbmkgTWl0Y2hlbGw%3D)**

Feeling like you had a tough Christmas last year with a burnt turkey? Spare a thought for Joni Mitchell, who finds herself heartbroken and yearning to escape the festive cheer all around her. The melancholic piano opening, with ‘Jingle Bells’ subtly woven in, sets the tone for a poignant journey – this won’t be your typical jolly ride, yet it remains strikingly beautiful and delicate. 

By the song’s end, you’ll be yearning to skate away with Joni (as she cries throughout the song) and help mend her broken heart. It’s no wonder this track has become one of her most covered and the best Christmas songs, embraced by over 500 artists who connect with its emotional depth and vulnerability.

![best christmas songs](images/best-christmas-songs-10.jpg "best-christmas-songs-10")

### **[22\. ‘Dominick the Donkey’ By Lou Monte](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca5wXojemRM&pp=ygUqMjIuIOKAmERvbWluaWNrIHRoZSBEb25rZXnigJkgQnkgTG91IE1vbnRl)**

Novelty songwriter Lou Monte, with rumors of a possible assist from the Gambino crime family, aimed for a Rudolph-level hit with this enchanting tale of a donkey tasked by Santa to ascend the hills of Italy. While the lofty ambitions for a massive hit didn’t quite materialize, Monte succeeded in crafting a song tailored specifically for Italian Americans. 

With legendary lines like ‘A pair of shoes for Louie and a dress for Josephine / The label on the inside says they’re made in Brook-a-leen,’ he secured a place in the obscure novelty song hall of fame. This karaoke gem resonates with those who truly appreciate its fun and catchy charm.

### **[23\. ‘Little Things’ by ABBA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0qO04Y9Pwk&pp=ygUfMjMuIOKAmExpdHRsZSBUaGluZ3PigJkgYnkgQUJCQQ%3D%3D)**

After a 40-year hiatus, ABBA – or perhaps their digital hologängers – finally treated us to new music. Surprisingly, it took them even longer to release a Christmas song. Despite its novelty, ‘Little Things’ carries a throwback vibe, transporting us back to the band’s heyday in 1973. Does this mean ABBA is timeless or that Christmas music remains unchanging? 

Ultimately, it doesn’t matter because when ABBA ventures into the twinkly and sentimental territory, it’s pure gold. Their enduring charm shines through, making ‘Little Things’ a delightful addition to their repertoire.

### **[24\. ‘Frosty the Snowman’ by Cocteau Twins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e874vKfYfuU&pp=ygUtMjQuIOKAmEZyb3N0eSB0aGUgU25vd21hbuKAmSBieSBDb2N0ZWF1IFR3aW5z)**

The 1950 classic receives a dreamy and ethereal keyboard makeover in the early ’90s, courtesy of the Scottish dreamers, the Cocteau Twins. While the song could have explored the aching sadness of a snowman’s existence, singer Elizabeth Fraser brings it to life with vocals that resemble shimmering colors and dancing forest fairies. The moment the overlapping harmonies join in around 1:36, you’re transported to a world where Christmas feels undeniably magical.

![best christmas songs](images/best-christmas-songs-11.jpg "best-christmas-songs-11")

### **[25\. ‘Christmas Vacation’ by Mavis Staples](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-hzsrzaYVs&pp=ygUtMjUuIOKAmENocmlzdG1hcyBWYWNhdGlvbuKAmSBieSBNYXZpcyBTdGFwbGVz)**

Indeed, this is the theme of the beloved Chevy Chase classic of the same name. However, even the most devoted fans often overlook the fact that soul icon Mavis Staples is the one lending her voice to the somewhat corny line, ‘Hip, hip hooray, for Christmas vacation.’ 

The shocking part is that this hidden gem isn’t a staple (pardon the pun), considering the prestigious talent behind the microphone, the film’s iconic status, and the undeniable quality of the song itself.
