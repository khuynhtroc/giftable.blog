## **Upcoming 2023 Halloween Horror Movies**

### **The Nun II**

![The Nun II](images/the-nun-2.jpg "the-nun-2")

Five years after “The Nun” became the top-grossing film in “The Conjuring” series, raking in over $365 million worldwide, Sister Irene (Taissa Farmiga), our favorite demon-battling nun, is returning to face Valak (Bonnie Aarons) once more. In “The Nun II,” directed by Michael Chaves, the story picks up from the first film’s suspenseful ending, where Valak escapes from the Abbey of St. Carta in Romania by inhabiting Maurice (Jonas Bloquet) as a vessel. Chaves explained to MovieWeb that Maurice ends up in France, working as a handyman at a boarding school, but we’re aware from the previous movie that something dreadful lies within him – Valak. Events draw Irene back into a fateful reunion with her old friend.

![](images/no-one-will-save-you.jpg "no-one-will-save-you")

The sci-fi psychological thriller “No One Will Save You” features Kaitlyn Dever, known for her Emmy and Golden Globe nominations, in the role of Brynn Adams. Brynn is a highly anxious person who leads a sheltered life. One night, she’s startled awake by the intrusion of aliens into her home. As the night unfolds, Brynn is forced to fight for her survival against these extraterrestrial invaders in her once-safe haven. In July, the director, Brian Duffield, humorously summarized the movie on Twitter: “If you ever wanted to see a film where Kaitlyn Dever repeatedly rejects a group of aliens trying to abduct her, we’ve got that covered.

### **Saw X (In theaters Sept. 29)**

![Saw X (In theaters Sept. 29)](images/saw-x-in-theaters-sept-29.jpg "saw-x-in-theaters-sept-29")

Set between the events of Saw I and II, the latest installment in the Saw series brings back Tobin Bell as the infamous Jigsaw Killer, John Kramer, for a sequel that delves into his past. Directed by Kevin Greutert, a veteran of the franchise, Saw X follows Kramer, who is terminally ill, as he travels to Mexico for an experimental medical procedure, only to discover it’s a fraudulent scheme. This doesn’t sit well with Jigsaw, prompting him to craft a series of sadistic torture traps for those who have deceived him.

Unlike previous films, this time the story is narrated from Kramer’s perspective, rather than that of his victims, as Greutert explained: “\[Saw X\] takes you on an emotional journey with John Kramer, rather than immersing you in a slaughterhouse from the victims’ point of view.” He believes it has the potential to appeal to a wider audience beyond just gore enthusiasts.

![](images/pet-sematary-bloodlines.jpg "pet-sematary-bloodlines")

Serving as a prequel to the 2019 film adaptation of Stephen King’s chilling 1983 novel, Pet Sematary, which King himself has dubbed his ‘scariest property of all time,’ Bloodlines is based on an untold chapter from the book, also penned by King. Set in 1969, the feature debut of filmmaker Lindsey Anderson Beer focuses on Jud Crandall (played by Jackson White), the elderly neighbor of the Creed Family from the original story, during his younger years when he harbored dreams of escaping his hometown, Ludlow, Maine.

Upon discovering a local cemetery with the eerie ability to bring the dead back to life, albeit with grim consequences, Jud grapples with a dark family legacy that forever binds him to Ludlow. Alongside his childhood friends, he confronts an ancient evil with the potential to obliterate everything in its path.

### **Malibu Horror Story**

![Malibu Horror Story](images/malibu-horror-story.jpg "malibu-horror-story")

Spanning a decade, “Malibu Horror Story” chronicles the journey of a team of paranormal investigators as they delve into the mysterious vanishing of four teenagers who disappeared in the California hills after stumbling upon a sacred Indigenous cave. Written and directed by Scott Slone, this found footage film has been in the making for over ten years and sets out to offer a fresh take on the clichéd theme of haunted Native American burial grounds.

Slone explained, “Our narrative unfolds through various perspectives, timelines, and layers of media collected over numerous years.
