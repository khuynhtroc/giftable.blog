**How to break up with a girl** you love or not love anymore is never easy, especially when it’s a sensitive girl. The entire process can feel like a gut-wrenching exercise in heartache and pain, leaving you feeling confused and lost. Even though there’s no guaranteed way to break up without hurting someone – or yourself – the right approach will minimize its negative effects. 

In this blog post, we’ll provide key advice on how to successfully break up with a girl without hurting her, remain respectful, considerate of her feelings, and be honest about why the relationship has ended.

## How to break up with a girl without hurting her

### Honestly tell her what’s not working and that you want to end the relationship

Give her a compliment first, then talk about the things in your relationship that aren’t working well. Finally, tell her honestly that you want to end your relationship with her. After that, apologize if it hurts, but assure her that it’s for the best.

For example, to break the news, you may start by stating, “I really appreciate talking to you,” followed by, “But I’m not prepared to commit to a serious, steady relationship now,” and then, “So I believe it’s for the best if we end things.”

Although it may be difficult, she has a right to reality.

### Avoid concentrating on what you believe they did badly

Be prepared for the breakup talk to be difficult. You can express how tough and frightening it is. Just because you’re splitting up with someone doesn’t mean you can’t experience a sorrowful time together.

Don’t make the relationship’s end into a blame game, no matter how you explain it. Make the argument about yourself instead. No one can fight with you about your own preferences or sentiments; nevertheless, they can fight with you if you are uncertain or make statements/assumptions about their feelings. 

To do so, utilize “I” sentences to express why you believe something isn’t happening.

### Be accountable for your part in the relationship

Take responsibility for your part in the breakdown of your relationship by taking the two-way street and owning up to any mistakes you may have made. Be open about what isn’t working, but also confess your part in those issues to show respect and thanks and help her feel less responsible.

_Be accountable for your part in the relationship_

For instance, you may say, “I know I haven’t been spending enough time with you, and that’s my fault.”

The breakdown of a relationship might occasionally be more her responsibility than yours. Even if she cheated on you, you should still treat her with respect when you [end the relationship](https://avada.io/loveable/how-to-end-a-friendship/).

### Pay attention to the reasons you choose to end your relationship with her

There must be something wrong with you if you feel like you want to leave your relationship with your partner. To assist you in coming up with arguments for why your needs aren’t being addressed and why you should split up with your girlfriend, consider the advice you’d offer a buddy in your shoes.

You may say to your friend, “She never makes time for you, and you feel like she’s keeping you from being happy,” as an example.

It might be challenging at times to look outside of ourselves and see an issue. Using the exercise as a starting point, you can view your circumstance differently.

### Explain to her that you need some space

Invite her to a meeting so you can discuss something serious. Be open and sincere about your emotions when you express that you believe a break would help you see your relationship with fresh eyes. For example, she may want to take a break because she loves you rather than just dump you.

Saying something like, “I simply don’t feel like we’re connecting anymore and I’d like to take a break to see how I truly feel about us,” would be a good example of what you might attempt.

After some time apart, if you still really believe that you don’t want to be with her, you might choose to end your relationship.

### Be kind to her and let her be unhappy

Though breaking up with her could be difficult, remember that it’s also tricky for her, especially regarding how to break up with a girlfriend you live with. So Permit her to experience hurt and sadness. Don’t lash out at her online or show your disgust. 

You must allow her room to move on because she will eventually do so. So even if the relationship ended poorly and you have bitterness or anger toward her, simply let it go. Better still, do so as soon as possible.

### If you can, tell her in person

Inform your girlfriend that you want to meet up so you may break the news to her in person. Try to arrange a video chat with her if you live too far apart to be able to meet up in person. This will allow her to see your face and hear your voice.

Someone finds how to break up with a girl over text, but breaking up by text or social media isn’t the most respectable or pleasant thing to do. Consider what it could be like to be in her position and how it might affect you. So be sensitive to her feelings and emotions as well.

### Avoid making false promises

So that’s all. A clean breakup talk, on the other hand, does not always indicate the absence of guilt and remaining love for her.

We have a tendency to want to leave things on a good note, making sure her satisfied in some manner. After the talk, avoid expressing fake desires, such as staying friends, if you don’t intend it. Whatever decision you make, stick to it and give that individual some space to let things calm down.

![Avoid making false promises](images/how-to-break-up-with-a-girl-3.jpg "how-to-break-up-with-a-girl-3")

_Avoid making false promises_

If you interact after the split, don’t be afraid to approach her. That may be really offensive. Simply say hello, talk about their life, and share yours, but most importantly, act in line with your view that this is a strong, resourceful someone who, although not the ideal match for you, is the right fit for someone else.
