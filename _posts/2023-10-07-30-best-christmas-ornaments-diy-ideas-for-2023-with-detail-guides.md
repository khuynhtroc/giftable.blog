![Polish Tree Ornaments](images/polish-tree-ornaments.jpg "polish-tree-ornaments")

Transforming simple wooden trees into festive decorations is a breeze! Just dip them into a cup filled with water mixed with two distinct shades of green nail polish. To ensure even coverage, dip with the tree upside down and let any excess polish drip off. Once you’re satisfied, flip the tree upright and let it dry. It’s as easy as that!

Buy [wooden tree from Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Wooden-Christmas-Crafts-Unfinished-Woodpeckers/dp/B081QRD1GP?ots=1&slotNum=0&imprToken=1ec4f995-0b3e-6170-b7d&linkCode=ogi&tag=womansday_auto-append-20&ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C10070.g.2019%5Bsrc%7Cwww.google.com%5Bch%7C%5Blt%7C%5Bpid%7C153be17f-dba7-47ae-9418-4acc8efce814) 

### **4\. Mini Bell Christmas Ornaments**

![Mini Bell Christmas Ornaments](images/mini-bell-christmas-ornaments.jpg "mini-bell-christmas-ornaments")

Adorn your front door with these charming ornaments, or elegantly drape them across your Christmas tree.

**Here’s how you can create them:** Stack mini molds and Bundt pans to craft bell shapes, securing them together with epoxy. Attach small ornaments to the lower part to fashion the clappers. For easy hanging, use hot glue to affix ribbon loops and a bow to the top. If you like, you can also include a swag of greenery to enhance the decoration.

Buy [mold from amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Bezall-Aluminum-Cupcake-Cookie-Pudding/dp/B00T5K0GGO/) 

### **5\. Beautiful Marbled Ornaments**

![Cute Mini Santa Ornament](images/cute-mini-santa-ornament.jpg "cute-mini-santa-ornament")

A delightful sight for all, Santa will bring joy to anyone who spots him perched on the tree in his charming mini walnut shell sleigh.

**Here’s how to craft this whimsical decoration:** Start by giving a small wooden peg doll expressive eyes using a fine-tip black marker. Envelop the doll’s body in red felt, using hot glue to hold it in place securely. Craft a tiny hat from red felt and attach it to the doll’s head using hot glue, then add a mini pom pom as the finishing touch. For the gift, cover a mini wooden cube with green felt, ensuring it stays put with hot glue. Fasten a ribbon around the present for added charm.

Prepare the walnut shell by drilling small holes on each end of a halved shell. Thread a piece of slender twine through each hole and secure it inside the shell with hot glue, knotting the twine at the top for hanging. Complete the scene by using hot glue to position Santa and his gift inside the shell.

You can find the necessary [mini wooden peg dolls](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00WQDTTCE) in the shop. Happy crafting!

### **9\. Personalized Wire Ornament**

![Personalized Wire Ornament](images/personalized-wire-ornament.jpg "personalized-wire-ornament")

Begin by elegantly writing a name in cursive style. Next, take a lengthy piece of wire and utilize pliers to carefully shape it to mirror the graceful curves of the written name. Conclude the wire with a charming loop or heart shape. To complete the design, delicately wrap the wire with baker’s twine or yarn, ensuring each letter is artfully covered. If needed, apply a few drops of glue to securely anchor the string in its place.

### **10\. Avocado Toast Ornaments**
