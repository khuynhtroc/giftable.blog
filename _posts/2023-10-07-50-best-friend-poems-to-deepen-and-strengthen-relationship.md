### **51\. I Am Always There – You’re Never Alone by Ashley Becker**

Friendship is a fair relationship in that we accept to share everything together with the same purpose of “finding pleasure.” What could be better than when we have a chance to meet like-minded people? The same purpose and same thinking; it’s great to never be lonely anymore. The world treats you badly, and friends will make up for your damage.
