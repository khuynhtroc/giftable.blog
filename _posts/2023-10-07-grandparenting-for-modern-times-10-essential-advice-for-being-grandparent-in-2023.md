## **10 Tips for Being the Best Grandparents**

![10 Tips for Being the Best Grandparents](images/grandparent2023-3.jpg "grandparent2023-3")

Be realistic, although you want to show off love to your babies. While it’s reasonable to want to pamper children, keep in mind that you are retired, and your financial condition may not allow it. Look back at your finance to make sure that what you do is affordable. Not overextending yourself financially, you will be providing a good example for your grandchildren on the value of financial responsibility.

### **Be Clear about Finance Problems** 

Grandparents often don’t have so much money that they can freely pay for their kids. If you’re having financial difficulties, inform your children that you cannot pay as much financial help as you’d want. Conversely, if you are willing and able to assist monetarily, make it plain what you can provide and when. Transparency in money may help minimize misunderstandings and decrease stress for all parties involved.

### **Always Keep in Touch**  

Nowadays, young couples tend to live far from their home as a nuclear family. There are several methods to stay in touch. Set up frequent video or phone chats to make idle chat on new things in their life through many social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, Skype, etc). Sending greeting words, images, or videos might help to strengthen your friendship. Remember that communication is a two-way connection, so encourage your grandchildren to contact you as well. 

### **Enjoy, and don’t be pressured**

10 Tips for Being the Best Grandparents 

Enjoy the moment being together, and don’t stress yourself out trying to have wonderful experiences. Being yourself; Even if it’s simply a casual activity, kids will value the time spent with you. Don’t feel obligated to organize extravagant trips or purchase expensive presents to demonstrate your affection. Concentrate on connecting with each other and enjoying each other’s company.

### **Be Patient With New Parents.**

Let them make their own decisions without being pushy or criticizing. Instead, when being requested, provide advice and support while respecting their parenting choices. It’s also essential to remember that being a new parent may be stressful and taxing, so be patient and understanding if they don’t always have time to interact with you as much as you want.

### **Stepback and Watch Them**  

Although you may have many experiences as a parent, keep in mind that every family is distinct, and what used to be effective for you doesn’t suit the new generation. Rather than delivering unwanted counsel, watch and appreciate your children’s parenting style. If they ask for your opinion, provide it calmly and politely, and be prepared to back down in case they reject it.

### **Don’t Let The Kids Eat Too Many Sweets**

It’s hard to reject when kids whine and ask for candy. However, excess sugar can cause health concerns as well as behavioral ones. As an exemplary grandparent, you can’t destroy kids’ health. Instead, look for healthful meals and keep the sugary sweets for special occasions. Encourage your grandchildren to try different fruits and vegetables, and include them in meal planning and preparation.

### **Let Bonding Happen Naturally**

Don’t try too hard to gain love because love must come from both sides. It’s not as easy as you can imagine. Remember that it will take your sincerity to create a solid relationship, but it is one of the most gratifying aspects of becoming a grandmother.

As mentioned, every family has its own method of education, so it’s impolite to break their authority. If the parents schedule a regular bedtime for kids, for example, don’t allow your grandchild to remain up past that hour. It is also important to follow any dietary restrictions or limitations imposed by the parents. Respecting the regulations of your grandchild’s parents that show your support. 

### **Speak Up When You Need Help**

Speak out and ask for support whenever you need a break or just a little help. Your grandchildren’s parents may not always recognize you need help, so don’t be hesitant to tell them when you need it.
