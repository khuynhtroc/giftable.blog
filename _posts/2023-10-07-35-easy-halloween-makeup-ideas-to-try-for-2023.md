## **35 Easy Halloween Makeup Ideas For A Fancy Halloween Look**

### **Mad Scientist Makeup**

![easy halloween makeup ideas](images/easy-halloween-makeup-ideas-3-960x549-1.jpg "easy-halloween-makeup-ideas-3-960x549-1")

In this easy Halloween makeup idea from YouTuber [Cydnee Black](https://www.youtube.com/c/CydneeBlack), you will look like a creepy scientist after an experiment has gone wrong. You will need a pair of protective glasses to achieve this look. First, trace black eyeshadow along the outside rim of your glasses and blend the lines out using a brush. You can add darker smoke around your face to create a haphazard effect.

### **David Bowie Halloween Makeup Idea**

![easy halloween makeup ideas](images/easy-halloween-makeup-ideas-28-960x615-1.jpg "easy-halloween-makeup-ideas-28-960x615-1")

[Ziggy Stardust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvZ5fLjLy0Y), David Bowie’s alter-ego, is ideal for [last-minute Halloween costumes](https://avada.io/loveable/last-minute-halloween-costumes-women/) since it does not really require clothes. For a classic Bowie look, powder your face before applying the face paint, then use water-based paints that will stay glossy all night long.

### **Carmen San Diego Makeup**

![easy halloween makeup ideas](images/easy-halloween-makeup-ideas-23.jpg "easy-halloween-makeup-ideas-23")

A strong [black liquid eyeliner](https://ulta.ztk5.net/c/3006986/164999/3037?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fstay-all-day-waterproof-liquid-eyeliner%3FproductId%3DxlsImpprod1840049&subId1=cos&subid3=xid:fr1689340804780fnh) is the basics you need for this easy Halloween makeup idea by drag queen [Krisa Gonna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPnpH4FIPvY). For your black Carmen brows, cover your brows with concealer and blend them into your skin tone with a spoolie. The minute you walk into their midst with this costume, everyone will start singing the theme song for sure. Be prepared!

### **Eleven from Stranger Things Makeup**

![easy halloween makeup ideas](images/easy-halloween-makeup-ideas-5.jpg "easy-halloween-makeup-ideas-5")

Still can’t get enough of Stranger Things 4? With this simple [Eleven makeup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVtlliN5g6U) from season 3, you just need fake blood under your nose. The rest of your makeup should be as natural as possible; just add clear brow gel to your eyebrows and a little brown mascara to your top lashes. You can make a huge style statement with an 80s-printed button-down and beach waves.

### **Spider-Eye Halloween Makeup Idea**

![easy halloween makeup ideas](images/easy-halloween-makeup-ideas-19.jpg "easy-halloween-makeup-ideas-19")

If you are not afraid of spiders, this easy Halloween makeup idea is perfect for some drama on Halloween night. It is super easy to achieve this [creepy-crawly eye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvrnA-v0mjU) using all the liquid [eye liners](https://avada.io/loveable/blog/halloween-eyeliner/) you have at home. And with some patience, of course. Free-hand stroke lines across your lid will be required, along with fanned-out lashes.

### **Bridgerton Makeup**

![easy halloween makeup ideas](images/easy-halloween-makeup-ideas-20-960x576-1.jpg "easy-halloween-makeup-ideas-20-960x576-1")

Lady Whistledown would absolutely go wow for this pink-toned makeup look. For the Bridgerton ladies’ sweet and natural look like YouTuber [Sophie Schumann](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np1eejqOw4U), blend some rose-toned eyeshadows all over your eyes and cheeks. Use a luminous primer and lots of highlighter on your cheekbones to keep your skin glowy.

### **Comic Book Effect Makeup**

![easy halloween makeup ideas](images/easy-halloween-makeup-ideas-8-960x581-1.jpg "easy-halloween-makeup-ideas-8-960x581-1")

Make the most of the spooky season with this pop-art look from [MaggieA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtSFpArx0pw). If you want your comic-book makeup to look animated, use black [face paint](https://avada.io/loveable/blog/halloween-face-paint-ideas/) to outline certain parts of your face and white dots on others. When the white dots are adorned with rhinestones, the effect will be like a comic-book page coming to life.

### **Skull Halloween Makeup Idea**

![easy halloween makeup ideas](images/easy-halloween-makeup-ideas-18.jpg "easy-halloween-makeup-ideas-18")

You can never go wrong with a skull look for an easy Halloween makeup idea. To make your skully look more realistic, this creator recommends using white foundation or face paint after creating the outline of the mouth and teeth.

### **Black Swan Makeup**

![easy halloween makeup ideas](images/easy-halloween-makeup-ideas-17-960x597-1.jpg "easy-halloween-makeup-ideas-17-960x597-1")

12 years later, is Black Swan still roaming your mind rent-free? Get in the Halloween spirit with black eyeliner-only Halloween makeup from Youtuber [Courtney Little Makeup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUwW2DfvPKU). With this costume, you will not have to worry about doing your brows since you’ll be drawing over them with black liner. Using a liquid eyeliner pen to outline the shape, then a flat brush and gel eyeliner pot to fill in large areas will save you a lot of time.

### **Fairy Makeup** 

![easy halloween makeup ideas](images/easy-halloween-makeup-ideas-15-960x574-1.jpg "easy-halloween-makeup-ideas-15-960x574-1")

Bringing it back to basics, shall we? There is nothing more classic than a fairy costume. Try something a bit different with your glam than just popping on a pair of Amazon wings. Get yourself inspired with this fairy makeup look from Youtuber [Mei Yan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPhyERPn20E). You will need a bunch of shimmers and some floral appliques, if you really want to go the extra mile.

### **Scarecrow Halloween Makeup Idea**

![easy halloween makeup ideas](images/easy-halloween-makeup-ideas-7-960x562-1.jpg "easy-halloween-makeup-ideas-7-960x562-1")

Creator [Suezochan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSCGgS7caBE)‘s scarecrow is not the typical warm-toned guy you would see at a pumpkin patch. You can make your Halloween look more dramatic with the usage of light oranges and blues since she recommends going a bit more messy when applying makeup. Any eyeshadow you have at home will do.

### **Violet Makeup from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory**

![easy halloween makeup ideas](images/easy-halloween-makeup-ideas-30.jpg "easy-halloween-makeup-ideas-30")

This easy Halloween makeup idea from [Julia Salvia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J56f4AXijKc) only requires blue makeup on the center of your face. As Violet’s face is almost completely blue in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, you can do the toned-down version and pair it with any makeup look that you like. To create the same effect, use colored eyeliner or cream eyeshadow and blend it all over your nose.

### **Queen Of Hearts Makeup**

![easy halloween makeup ideas](images/easy-halloween-makeup-ideas-16-960x563-1.jpg "easy-halloween-makeup-ideas-16-960x563-1")

This look from Youtuber [MASKARA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrJQjuk6ZeU) involves a bit of arts and [crafts expertise](https://avada.io/loveable/blog/easy-halloween-craft-ideas/), as well as some makeup skills. The tutorial is perfect, but it can be customized to suit your style. You can cut the fake blood and ditch the décolletage makeup if you wish. However, the deck of cards headband is essential for a complete look. 

### **Barbie Halloween Makeup Idea**

![easy halloween makeup ideas](images/easy-halloween-makeup-ideas-14-960x591-1.jpg "easy-halloween-makeup-ideas-14-960x591-1")

Halloween is the perfect time to rock Barbie’s adorable look. Put on a blonde wig, wear a pink dress, and follow this step-by-step pink eye makeup tutorial from Lashay’s Glamz. You can also have your other half dress up as a very spray-tanned Ryan Gosling for a couple Halloween costumes.

### **Mermaid Halloween Makeup Idea**

![easy halloween makeup ideas](images/easy-halloween-makeup-ideas-32.jpg "easy-halloween-makeup-ideas-32")

Get this Halloween look from [Amy-Rose Walker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtQL9tUgVRw&t=4s) by starting with a glam makeup routine. After applying a thin line of blue eyeshadow under your eyes, apply blue and green glitter around the eyeshadow and upward toward your temples.

### **Cupid Makeup**

![easy halloween makeup ideas](images/easy-halloween-makeup-ideas-21-960x599-1.jpg "easy-halloween-makeup-ideas-21-960x599-1")

In this easy Halloween makeup idea, red is the color of choice: red lipstick, red blush, and red eyeliner. You can also add your own touch with a white graphic line above your crease with a red heart on one side, as [Glownicky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98MXj_ZZv2E) did above.

### **Marilyn Monroe Makeup**

![easy halloween makeup ideas](images/easy-halloween-makeup-ideas-22-960x570-1.jpg "easy-halloween-makeup-ideas-22-960x570-1")

As a result of the film Blonde starring Ana De Armas, Marilyn will be everywhere this Halloween. Make it Marilyn’s way this October with red lipstick, winged eyeliner, contour, neutral eyeshadow, and her iconic beauty mark. Do not worry if this makeup appears a bit harsh: Makeup artist Jordi of itslikelymakeup suggests using a translucent powder all over the face to soften the edges.

### **Zombie Halloween Makeup Idea**

![easy halloween makeup ideas](images/easy-halloween-makeup-ideas-24-960x588-1.jpg "easy-halloween-makeup-ideas-24-960x588-1")

The zombie look is all about intense shadows and highlights, so it is time to pull out that contour palette you barely use. To get that monstrous look, apply a full-coverage foundation two to three shades lighter than your natural skin tone, then contour your nose, cheekbones, and temples with a cool-toned contour. To finish off the look, Youtuber [Melissa Alatorre](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptx7iNE_gU8) used red lipstick and smokey eyeshadow to mimic blood around her mouth.

### **Vampire Makeup**

![easy halloween makeup ideas](images/easy-halloween-makeup-ideas-10-960x558-1.jpg "easy-halloween-makeup-ideas-10-960x558-1")

Is Halloween wouldn’t be Halloween without some vampire makeup? Creator [Layla Rose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kit-LcMg3cg) shows us how to make this Halloween makeup idea even scarier with thick, smudged, smoky eyes and red novelty contacts.

### **Emma Stone’s Cruella Makeup**

![easy halloween makeup ideas](images/easy-halloween-makeup-ideas-29-960x564-1.jpg "easy-halloween-makeup-ideas-29-960x564-1")

Thanks to Emma Stone’s Cruella, Cruella de Vil makeup tutorials are everywhere online, but most are complicated to recreate if you are a makeup beginner. To cash in on Cruella vibes, YouTuber [Laura Gilbert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSaHK58-aeM) displays red lips, smokey eyes, and powdered skin, all without having to glue on your eyebrows.

### **Cheetah Makeup**

![easy halloween makeup ideas](images/easy-halloween-makeup-ideas-4-960x542-1.jpg "easy-halloween-makeup-ideas-4-960x542-1")

Cheetah makeup is sensational for Halloween. With this easy Halloween makeup idea from [Kayla Marie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EL74osaAv2c), ears are totally optional. You can make some squiggles around your temples using a no-smudge eyeliner. Put on a black lip, fill in the spots with champagne eyeshadow, and you’re all set!

### **Sunflower Halloween Makeup Idea**

![easy halloween makeup ideas](images/easy-halloween-makeup-ideas-27.jpg "easy-halloween-makeup-ideas-27")

If you are looking for something cute this Halloween, Alexandra Anele’s sunflower-themed eye look is the one for you.

Then, apply yellow eye paint to each petal and deepen it using a brown eyeshadow stick.

You can DIY skinny brows by covering them first with the glue stick method (watch [Jackie Wyers’ tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92Exu4CeZ7E) for inspiration) or by drawing a thin line through the brow’s tail. Also, it wouldn’t be complete without the blonde wig!

This easy Halloween makeup idea is for all Twilight fans out there! For the lifted eye look like Youtuber [Kelsie Kristine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYX7C3HALkI), you will need concealer and powder to conceal the tail of your natural brows.

Try this makeup look from [TianaCosmetics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocHE8NBMuVU) to pay tribute to the most fashionable group of dolls of all time.

After mixing some water into the red pigment, use a small eyeshadow brush to flick the wet mixture onto the eye area.
