Finding the right person to spend your life with can be one of the toughest tasks ever. After all, love is a complex emotion that depends on many aspects, such as trust, communication, and understanding. However, these elements are key ingredients for a successful relationship where both partners share endless affection and admiration towards each other. 

But being a good partner isn’t always easy; it takes patience, thoughtfulness, and dedication from both members of the couple to maintain an everlasting connection that stands out from any other kind of love. In this article, we will discover unique tips on **how to be a better lover** for your special someone so that you can cement your affection even more! 

How to Be A Better Lover
------------------------

### 1\. Start by actively listening to your partner’s desire

While this is not always the case, many women express their desires in bed. Pay attention to what your spouse says and do as they direct. After all, no one understands your partner’s physique better than you!

They will sometimes alert you when they desire a certain sexual act or vocally tell you how to perform it. Other times, you can tell what they’re thinking by the moans they make.

When you’re listening, your body language counts. If she appears frightened, do everything you can to reassure her that you will not pass judgment on her.

### 2\. Need to have an open mind

Having an open mind is necessary while communicating with a partner. However, to be a better lover, keep in mind that you need to practice. Making someone feel uneasy or passing judgment at this time is not appropriate.

Try to keep the topic clear of any emotional outbursts or juvenile remarks. You definitely don’t want your lover to regret being open with you.

In the end, you have to be willing to listen to them and speak up if they say something that surprises you or otherwise confuses you, as it is the issue of the two-way nature of communication.

_Try a new sexual technique_

As you initially get into a new relationship, the sex gets more intense. But as you settle into a pattern, the thrill disappears and mellows down. Fortunately, there are many simple techniques you can apply to your relationship to bring excitement back into the equation. 

Allowing them into your thoughts, bringing in sex toys, or having a quickie in the drive because you can’t wait to go home might all be signed. For excitement, you might even surprise them with sex in the morning instead of your normal midnight session.

### 4\. Priority in foreplay which should implement outside the bedroom

Most guys think that loving yourself starts and finishes in the bedroom. Some people also think that having sex entails penetration and a quick round of fingering. With a good lover, none of these is true.

Rushing to the big event will undoubtedly make intimacy feel artificial. Both ladies and you don’t want that. It’ll get monotonous. Instead, create some anticipation by teasing them.

### 5\. Remember to laugh off stupid things while making love

_Remember to laugh off stupid things while making love_

While we’ve been taught to believe that sex is only pleasurable when both people have an orgasm, there are a variety of reasons why you or your partner may not have one—and that’s perfectly OK. Goal-oriented sex takes us out of the present moment and has the potential to diminish pleasure, joy, and real closeness. 

Taking climax off the table and playing in the erotic—slowly going toward and away from feeling and pleasure—can be fascinating. Without the strain of sex, it may still be a lot of pleasure to indulge in activities like reciprocal masturbation, couples massage, or simple couch cuddles.

### 6\. Confront a sexual dysfunction issue head-on if you have this problem

You may stop worrying about sex by taking care of that sexual problem. Working to improve your self-image has a certain sense of empowerment.

Eighty percent of people experience some form of sexual dysfunction. Erectile dysfunction may occasionally be brought on by sadness or a poor diet. Other times, it’s a question of feeling cut off from your sexuality or having issues with your physical appearance.

Finding the most straightforward path to improving as a lover is easy. You must address the difficulties, even those you are aware of, preventing you from having better sex.

### 7\. Study up on sex

Sex is more than just P in V and little foreplay! Even sex professionals, believe it or not, learn how to give orgasms on a regular basis. So you can never go wrong by attempting to learn more about sex practices or how to enhance sexual enjoyment.

The greatest approach to becoming a better lover is to understand how to please your spouse in a variety of ways. This covers the following topics:

*   Learn how to use contraception correctly. Did you realize that when used correctly, condoms are only 98 percent effective? Condoms are just 85 percent effective in real life. Using birth control will keep your sexual connection safe and relieve your spouse’s stress.
*   Understand the concept of consent. Consent is the most effective way to make your spouse feel heard in the bedroom.
*   Learn about BDSM or enroll in a sex class. Understanding how to use a vibrator, knowing about anal play, or even understanding how to use floggers is a huge benefit.
*   Consider what you learned in porn. While porn is frequently used to teach guys about sex, the fact is that what you see has nothing to do with what a true, healthy sexual relationship looks like.

### 8\. Well aware that a sexual relationship is based on an emotional connection

It is possible to have excellent sex with someone you don’t care about, but it is not simple. Some people are unable to have sexual excitement if they are emotionally distant. In many circumstances, your atmosphere and connection are more important than the intercourse itself.

Encouraging intimacy is one of the things you can do to be a better lover. Intimacy is not synonymous with sex. It’s more about the bond and connection you experience via shared activities like hugging, snuggling, and joyful banter.

Being intimate with a partner implies that you may feel vulnerable in their presence and that you have a connection with them. This is why dates are so important in achieving that level of closeness. It isn’t just about the sex. It is what you do to feed that urge.

### 9\. Be enthusiastic

A good lover is enthusiastic about his romantic life and strongly desires genuine connection. Many women want to see more of it in the bedroom, from the kissing to the groaning.

Relationships that demonstrate a strong passion for one party only stay short. This is especially true in long-term and sexual partnerships. You should seriously rethink your connection with someone if you are not truly attracted to them.

When they are depressed, many men mistakenly believe they have lost their attraction to their partners. Before you leave your partner, consider whether you still have an interest in things like the job or the news. Are you depressed? These symptoms of depression are universally acknowledged to exist.

### 10\. Make sure that you’re always attractive while making love

_Make sure that you’re always attractive while making love_

The good news is that being attractive does not mean becoming totally perfect, but just being your best version. There are several strategies to increase your appeal to ladies, such as:

*   Eat healthily and exercise. You may get a female or a sex partner without having to be physically fit. Some ladies like having sex with all kinds of guys, so do not stress out too much if your body is naturally not perfect. Workouts and a balanced diet can help you feel your best and stay healthy and happy.
*   Take a bath. Try to make sure you don’t smell awful before every sexual encounter. And don’t let your body odor be overwhelming, also brush your teeth, wash your behind and genitalia, deodorize your pits, and wash your feet at the very least.
*   Put on a comfortable outfit. You don’t have to dress up like a model, but you can’t appear like a potato in front of your girl!
*   Have a positive attitude. A negative view about previous relationships or something like that will make you appear bad in the eyes of your partner. When you accuse women all the time, you are likely to fail because of arbitrary decisions or become overtly defensive. So make sure to remain a positive attitude.

### 11\. Maintain a conversation with your partner after as well as between sexual moments

Every relationship will improve if you communicate about how you’re feeling and what you want to explore. So, how does this appear? It’s straightforward. Experiment with new things in the bedroom, and then ask your spouse how they liked it.

Try a new sexual practice every now and again and see how it goes. It’s a hit if they appear willing to do it again or bring up a sex act they want to attempt. If the act in question provided you or your partner with a lot of sexual pleasure, it was a miss.

Similarly, it is OK to be proactive and state that particular conduct seems improper or difficult to perform. Being a decent lover means you won’t wind up being the person whose spouse detects pain.

### 12\. Get wise to the signs to finish a session early

Both you and your lover should enjoy your lovemaking sessions. Unfortunately, women do not always feel comfortable denying sex. This can result in really negative experiences. Avoiding this situation is a part of being a better lover.

While they may interact with you if you’re hot and they want to satisfy you, keep in mind that consent is more than just saying yes.

If your spouse appears uninterested, it may be time to push the stop button or end the sex session wholly.

Common mistakes you need to avoid
---------------------------------

First, not many men are prepared to accept the fact that they are not the best lovers for their wives or girlfriends. His initial mistake keeps him from beginning constructive improvements and to be a better lover.

There is also the issue of male selfishness. They make little effort to understand the woman’s preferences or care about her enjoyment. These men believe that every lady is the same and has the same sex desires. In truth, some women seek for more gentle partners while others like dominant males in bed.

On the other hand, many husbands are willing to learn how to treat their wives better love, but they are not prepared to act in reality. A lot of work and patience is needed to change things, but only some are aware of this. They continue to lead the same lifestyle and do the same errors in the bedroom as a consequence.
