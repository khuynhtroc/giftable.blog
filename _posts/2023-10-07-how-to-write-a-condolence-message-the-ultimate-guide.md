## **The effective components of creating a significant condolence message**

The effective components of creating a significant condolence message

### **Ensure it’s heartfelt**

First and foremost, you must ensure that the letter is truly your heart and you really want sympathy with them. Those can’t be fake words because you can get denounced, which is not good. Although they are in pain and need [love messages](https://avada.io/loveable/write-a-love-letter/) to come over, words that don’t come from your heart will be scorned as a liar. 

Besides, you must consider selective words that you tend to jot down in your sympathizing letter. Don’t use hurtful words, and you have to paraphrase them to be less painful. They are vulnerable now, so a wish like “he is to beautiful heaven” is better. 

### **A thorough understanding of the situation**

The success of your message is reliant on tact and sensitivity. Check the background information certainly to ensure what you are preparing to do. Don’t show like you know everything, don’t make it as a courtesy, you are responsible for what you write. 

### **Don’t pretend**

As in the first principle, you write a condolence message for genuine comfort, not for courtesy. How to write a condolence message if you don’t really want to do it? No way. They will have a bad look, even hatred for your fakeness. 

Don’t pretend like you know everything, like telling them, “I know this feeling, ” or “I have already overcome a similar pain.” If you’ve never lost someone close to you, claiming to understand how they feel may be ridiculous. Even if you’ve had a catastrophic loss, don’t assume you understand everything. You cannot take their side this way, and you will even have a hateful look in their eyes.

### **Be sensitive**

![Be sensitive](images/condolence-message3.jpg "condolence-message3")

Be sensitive

They are sensitive at this moment. Therefore, you must be cautious before doing any act. You cannot say something absurd just to comfort them. It even backfired and made them feel angry. Creating an uncomfortable atmosphere on their side, they will never want to meet you anymore. 

For example, you say that “he is to beautiful heaven” is nonsense and bullshit if they don’t believe in any religion.  

### **Consider the medium**

Do you tend to give them a call or a short message? A short message, a handwritten condolence message, would be a better choice for them to console because they are not ready to pick up the phone. You can give the message along with some suitable flowers to ensure that they can get your intention. 

### **Share a few unforgettable memories**

If the receiver is very familiar to you, it could be your best friend or relatives; you can remind some memorable memories of you and the descent when writing a condolence message for them. 

It’s probably that you also have a chance to meet the deceased to comfort their family with sympathy. So let’s share this pain with the receiver. Show them you are by their side to get through this terrible event.

How to write a condolence message

So, how to write a condolence message effectively? You have to consider who is the receiver of your letter. The message will also alter based on how close the receiver is to you.

Writing a sympathy card to a friend will, for example, differ from writing a condolence message to a spouse or family member.

### **Condolence message to a friend**

The two of you are close and have the same generation, so it is easier to share sadness. You can use comfortable words to write a sympathy message for them. They are really weak at the moment; remember that you are just friends, so don’t mention something over the boundary.
