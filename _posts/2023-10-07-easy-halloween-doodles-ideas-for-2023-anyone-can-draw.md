## **The History of Halloween Doodles**

![halloween doodles](images/halloween-doodles-1.jpg "halloween-doodles-1")

Halloween, an ancient Celtic festival known as Samhain, marked the end of the harvest season and the beginning of winter when the boundaries between the living and the dead were believed to blur. 

Over the centuries, it evolved into the modern celebration we know today, characterized by costumes, trick-or-treating, and spooky decorations. One such aspect of Halloween’s allure is its association with eerie and macabre imagery, which has inspired artists to create Halloween-themed doodles.

Early Halloween doodling can be traced back to different cultures. Celtic people carved turnips and later [carved pumpkins](https://avada.io/loveable/blog/halloween-pumpkin/) to ward off evil spirits during Samhain. In Medieval Europe, people drew images of ghosts, witches, and skeletons in prayer books on All Hallows’ Eve, a precursor to Halloween. In Mexican culture, Dia de los Muertos (Day of the Dead) showcases intricate doodles of sugar skulls and Calaveras, celebrating the lives of deceased loved ones.

As Halloween spread, doodling became a popular way to celebrate the festivities. In the 19th century, Halloween greeting cards adorned with whimsical and eerie doodles gained popularity. These doodles often featured black cats, witches on broomsticks, and haunted houses. In the early 20th century, newspaper comic strips incorporated Halloween themes, introducing iconic characters like Casper the Friendly Ghost.

With the advent of technology, Halloween doodles found a new platform. Search engines like Google began creating annual Halloween-themed doodles to celebrate the holiday. These doodles transformed into interactive and [animated artworks](https://avada.io/loveable/blog/easy-halloween-craft-ideas/) that captured the spirit of Halloween while engaging audiences worldwide.

Today, Halloween doodles have evolved into impressive artworks, with talented artists showcasing their skills on various social media platforms. From detailed illustrations of mythical creatures to digital animations of eerie landscapes, Halloween doodles have become an integral part of the holiday’s visual culture.
