![Halloween Potluck Ideas](images/creepy-eyeball-pasta.jpg "creepy-eyeball-pasta")

Spaghetti and meatballs are a timeless favorite for potluck gatherings, but when it comes to [Halloween dinner](https://avada.io/loveable/blog/halloween-dinner-ideas/), ordinary just won’t cut it—it needs to be delightfully spooky! In the past, we’ve enjoyed festive dishes like Jack-o’-Lantern stuffed peppers and ghost pizza bagels. However, our latest obsession revolves around transforming regular meatballs into eerie masterpieces that resemble monstrous eyeballs. It’s an exciting way to add a frightful touch to our Halloween feast!

### **2\. Delicious Pumpkin Curry**

![Halloween Potluck Ideas](images/delicious-pumpkin-curry.jpg "delicious-pumpkin-curry")

The natural, sweet flavors of pumpkin create an excellent foundation for a tantalizing Thai-inspired coconut milk curry with a hint of spice. To enhance the dish, we start by roasting the pumpkin, allowing it to develop a delightful caramelization and nutty undertones. As a next step, we take a portion of the roasted pumpkin and blend it into the curry sauce, introducing an additional dimension of pumpkin essence to the overall flavor profile. The result is a mouthwatering combination that’s sure to please the taste buds!

### **3\. Mini Ghost Pizza**

![Halloween Potluck Ideas](images/mini-ghost-pizza.jpg "mini-ghost-pizza")

The most frightening aspect of these pizza bagels is the speed at which we’ll devour them.  We highly suggest employing a cookie cutter to create ghost-shaped bagels, and feel free to experiment with different shapes if you have them on hand!

### **4\. Pub Beer Cheese**

![Halloween Potluck Ideas](images/pub-beer-cheese.jpg "pub-beer-cheese")

This recipe is a perfect choice for any party, as it not only comes together in a matter of minutes but also requires just a single bowl, making cleanup a breeze. Talk about effortlessness! The best part is that you can use whichever type of beer suits your taste buds—whether it’s a hoppy IPA, a creamy stout, or perhaps even your beloved pumpkin beer if you’re feeling adventurous. The options are endless, allowing you to tailor the dish to your preferred flavor profile. So go ahead and enjoy the simplicity and versatility of this delightful recipe at your next gathering!

### **5\. Roasted Butternut Squash Soup Halloween Potluck** 

![Halloween Potluck Ideas](images/roasted-butternut-squash-soup-halloween-potluck.jpg "roasted-butternut-squash-soup-halloween-potluck")

When it comes to capturing the essence of falling leaves and the crisp autumn air, opinions may vary. While some argue that pumpkin pie or warm apple cider takes the crown, for us, nothing complements the October sweater weather quite like a comforting serving of butternut squash soup. Its flavors perfectly harmonize with the season. If you’re planning to bring this to a potluck, make sure to save yourself a portion in advance, because once it hits the table, there won’t be a single leftover to take home!

### **6\. Graveyard Chicken Enchilada Dip**

![Halloween Potluck Ideas](images/graveyard-chicken-enchilada-dip.jpg "graveyard-chicken-enchilada-dip")

Creating this easy graveyard requires fewer than 10 ingredients, and you may even find some of them already stocked in your pantry! If you prefer a more convenient approach, don’t hesitate to utilize store-bought ingredients. However, if you’re feeling adventurous, consider making your enchilada sauce from scratch, preparing homemade chicken, and crafting a personalized taco seasoning blend to elevate the dish. The choice is yours, and both options guarantee a delicious outcome for your culinary graveyard masterpiece.

### **7\. Pumpkin Chili Halloween Potluck Ideas** 

![Halloween Potluck Ideas](images/pumpkin-chili-halloween-potluck-ideas.jpg "pumpkin-chili-halloween-potluck-ideas")

Trick or treat! This unique recipe takes a delightful twist by incorporating kabocha squash instead of the usual pumpkin. Kabocha squash offers a flavor profile that falls somewhere between the creamy richness of butternut squash and the satisfying sweetness of a starchy sweet potato. Its taste is wonderfully complex, boasting floral undertones and earthy hints of chestnut. 

Interestingly, the kabocha squash’s forest green rind, which can appear somewhat eerie, is actually completely edible once the squash is cooked through. This means you can skip the hassle of peeling it before adding it to your chili. Embrace the flavors and convenience of kabocha squash in this recipe for a delightful and slightly spooky twist on a classic dish.

Firstly, our mummy hot dogs are skillfully stuffed with cheese, taking them to a whole new level of deliciousness. As you take a bite, the ooey-gooey surprise of melty cheese will undoubtedly elevate your taste experience.
