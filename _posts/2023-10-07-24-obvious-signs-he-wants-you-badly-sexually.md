The sexual attraction is a natural human response, and sometimes it can be difficult to discern if someone is interested in you purely for sexual reasons. However, there are often clear signs that someone is sexually attracted to you, and being able to recognize these signs can help you navigate potential relationships with more confidence and understanding. 

Welcome to our guide on 23 obvious **signs that he wants you sexually**. In this guide, we will find out some of the most common signs that a man is sexually interested in you, helping you to understand his intentions better and make more informed decisions about your own desires and boundaries. An erection is also a pretty clear sign that he likes you sexually, yeah, pretty clear. But can we talk about the signs that aren’t as hard to miss?

## What Sex Means To A Man?

![What Sex Means To A Man?](images/screenshot_170-960x649-1.jpg "screenshot_170-960x649-1")

Sex can hold a significant level of importance for many men, both physically and emotionally. Physically, sex can be a means of releasing built-up sexual tension and experiencing pleasure. It can also have a good impact on a man’s physical health, as it can help lower stress levels, reduce blood pressure, and improve cardiovascular health.

Emotionally, sex can also play an important role for men. It can provide a sense of intimacy and connection with a partner and can help strengthen the emotional bond between two people. For some men, sex can also be a means of affirming their masculinity and feeling desired by a partner.

However, it’s not hard to understand that not all men place the same level of importance on sex, and each individual’s relationship with sex can be influenced by many factors, including personal values, cultural and societal norms, and individual experiences. Additionally, the importance of sex in a man’s life can fluctuate over time, depending on factors such as age, relationship status, and overall health and well-being. Just because every man’s sexual experience and needs are different, you shouldn’t judge his love for you by sex only or have to hesitate to see if he loves you only because of sex or not.

## 24 Obvious Signs He Wants You Sexually

### **You Notice That He Often Looks At You.**

![You Notice That He Often Looks At You.](images/screenshot_3-6-960x574-1.jpg "screenshot_3-6-960x574-1")

When a man is gazing at you, you may wonder if he’s sexually attracted to you. While this can be the case in certain situations, it’s important to note that men tend to stare when they’re interested in someone.

### **He Looks For Opportunities To Be Near You**

A man who is sexually attracted to a woman often desires physical proximity to her. Therefore, if you notice that he deliberately sits close to you or places his hands around your chair, it could be an attempt to communicate his attraction to you. On the other hand, if he’s not interested in you, he may try to maintain some distance to avoid giving the wrong impression.

### **He Wants To Spend More Time Being With You**

![He Wants To Spend More Time Being With You](images/screenshot_3-960x632-1.png "screenshot_3-960x632-1")

If a man is strongly attracted to you, he may desire to spend as much time with you as possible. This could manifest in various ways, such as asking you out on dates during his free time or suggesting coffee or a movie together.

This behavior can indicate that he’s not only physically interested in you but also wants to know you better and see if you are compatible with him. Regular dates can provide an opportunity for both of you to learn more about each other and for him to demonstrate that you’re important to him.

In any case, his eagerness to spend time with you is a clear sign that he desires you greatly and doesn’t want to wait any longer.

### **He Maintains Eye Contact With You.**

![He Maintains Eye Contact With You.](images/screenshot_171-960x634-1.jpg "screenshot_171-960x634-1")

Intense eye contact is often an indicator that someone is attracted to you. If a man consistently makes eye contact with you during the conversation, it could be a sign that he’s genuinely interested in what you have to say and finds you attractive.

If you also feel a mutual attraction, it’s important to reciprocate the eye contact to show that you’re aware of his attention and interested in him as well. This can reinforce the connection between the two of you and create a deeper level of intimacy.

### **He Smiles With You A Lot** 

When a man smiles a lot around you, it can be an indication that he wants your lips and wants to make you feel comfortable. People tend to smile more around those they’re interested in, so if you notice him grinning frequently, it could be a positive sign.

To demonstrate your own interest in him, it’s important to smile back and reciprocate his positive energy. This can convey that you enjoy spending time with him and make him feel more confident in pursuing a romantic connection with you.

### **He Answers All Your Message So Fast** 

![He Answers All Your Message So Fast ](images/screenshot_172.jpg "screenshot_172")

If a man is interested in you, he’s likely to respond to your texts promptly, as he won’t want to miss an opportunity to communicate with you or make plans to meet up. While this behavior could be an indication that he’s only looking for a physical relationship, it’s also possible that he’s seeking a more meaningful connection with you as a friend or romantic partner.

### **He Sweats and Fidgets Around You**

When a man becomes sexually aroused, his entire nervous system and circulation speed up. This can lead to an increase in heart rate and dryness in the mouth, similar to symptoms of anxiety. However, it’s important to note that this anxiety is typically positive in nature, often resulting in a feeling of excitement or butterflies in the stomach.

One common physical manifestation of this arousal is sweating and fidgeting. You may notice that he’s clammy or sweaty to the touch, and beads of sweat may appear on his face. Additionally, he may start fidgeting or moving around in a restless manner. All of these signs can indicate that he’s turned on and attracted to you.

### **He Creates A Playlist For You** 

![He Creates A Playlist For You ](images/screenshot_173-960x647-1.jpg "screenshot_173-960x647-1")

If a man is into you, he may put together a playlist of songs designed to set a romantic or intimate mood. If you notice that he’s done this, it could be a sign that he’s attracted to you and looking to take things to the next level.

When you listen to the songs on the playlist, consider what message they’re sending and whether you’ve noticed any other changes in his behavior towards you. These signs can help you determine whether he’s genuinely interested in pursuing a relationship with you.

### **He Steers The Talk Toward Sexual Topics.**

If a man constantly steers the conversation toward sexual topics, it’s a clear indication that he’s interested in sex. Regardless of what you try to discuss with him, he always seems to bring the conversation back to sex. This persistent behavior is a sign that he’s very focused on the idea of being intimate with you.

### **He Spoils You** 

![He Spoils You ](images/screenshot_81-1-960x635-1.jpg "screenshot_81-1-960x635-1")

Many men believe that [giving romantic gifts to a woman](https://avada.io/loveable/gifts-women-who-has-everything/) increases their chances of having sex with her. Giving gifts is one of the most obvious signs that a man desires a woman. However, there’s nothing wrong with traditional courtship and showing affection through gift-giving.

### **He Shares His Fantasies** 

One behavior that can be unsettling is when a man shares his sexual fantasies with you, such as desires for threesomes or public sex, and then asks you about your own fantasies. If you feel comfortable discussing your sexual fantasies, you can engage in the conversation. However, if you don’t want to talk about it, you can tell him that it makes you uncomfortable. If he continues to press the issue, then it’s a clear sign that he’s only interested in having sex with you.

### **He Copies Your Body Language.**

![He Copies Your Body Language.](images/screenshot_174.jpg "screenshot_174")

Mirroring someone’s body language is a sign that they like you. Test this by taking a sip of your drink or placing your hands on your hips. Does he copy you? If so, it’s likely he’s attracted to you. Mirroring is usually done unconsciously, so he may not even realize he’s doing it.

If you want to reciprocate his interest, try mirroring his body language as well. You don’t have to make it obvious, but if he crosses his legs, try crossing yours too.

### **He Is Interested In Seeing You In Revealing Clothing.**

When a man desires you, he may express his interest in seeing you in lingerie. He may even ask if you have any and offer to buy some for you. This kind of behavior is not subtle and makes it clear that he has sexual intentions toward you.

### **He’s Doing You Huge Favors**

![He's Doing You Huge Favors](images/screenshot_175-960x641-1.jpg "screenshot_175-960x641-1")

Some men may believe that doing favors for women is a way to increase their chances of having sex with them. If a man is going out of his way to do favors for you that he wouldn’t do for others, it’s likely that he has ulterior motives and is interested in you sexually.

### **He Looks for Ways to Touch You.**

A man who feels sexually attracted to you will look for ways to touch you. He’ll lean in close, accidentally brush against you, or simply try to be near you whenever possible.

If you’re interested in him, this is a great opportunity to get closer without being too obvious. After all, he’s already making the first move.

However, if you’re not interested, you need to be clear about it. Simply moving away from him physically may not be enough. You may need to tell him that you’re not interested in order to avoid any confusion or misinterpretation directly.

### **He Compliments You A Lot**

![He Compliments You A Lot](images/screenshot_176-960x607-1.jpg "screenshot_176-960x607-1")

Do you know someone who is always quick to compliment you? This is a rare occurrence, so the person likely has a strong attraction toward you. They may frequently tell you how beautiful you look, how nice you smell, or other compliments that you enjoy hearing.

### **He Flirts with You**

This is playful, and light-hearted flirting is often used to tease the other person and make them blush. While a guy who is attracted to you may occasionally engage in this type of flirting, a guy who wants you badly will be more direct with his flirting. He will make more eye contact with you, smile at you frequently, and touch you more often when you’re together.

He will also use sexual language when talking to you, be confident in his actions, and not hesitate to make a move on you in front of your friends when you’re out together. Flirting is a significant indicator of a guy’s intentions. If he openly flirts with you and makes sexual comments, it’s a clear sign that he wants you.

### **He Tells You Naughty Jokes** 

![He Tells You Naughty Jokes ](images/screenshot_177-960x579-1.jpg "screenshot_177-960x579-1")

If a man is making a lot of naughty jokes, telling sexual stories, and dropping innuendos frequently, it’s a sign that he’s only interested in a quick, casual sexual encounter without any strings attached. However, if you notice these behaviors early on in the relationship and feel uncomfortable with how quickly things are progressing, it’s important to take a step back and reconsider your boundaries.

### **He Introduces You To His Friends**

If you have met your boyfriend’s dude, it could tell you that he is not only sexually attracted to you but also interested in having a deeper relationship with you. If his intentions were solely focused on having sex with you, he would likely keep your relationship a secret and not introduce you to his friends.

### **When He’s With You, He Turns Red.**

![When He's With You, He Turns Red.](images/screenshot_178-960x622-1.jpg "screenshot_178-960x622-1")

If the guy you’re interested in is shy and introverted, he may become easily embarrassed and blush when he’s around you. This is a subtle sign that he’s attracted to you and wants you badly, but he may be too hesitant to express his feelings overtly. Therefore, if you suspect that he’s the shy type, keep an eye out for this behavior as a potential indication of his interest. It may require you to be observant and attentive to pick up on this sign.

### **He Cares More About How He Looks When You’re Around.**

If you notice that he puts more effort into his appearance when he’s around you, it’s a clear sign that he’s attracted to you and wants you sexually. He cares about how he looks in your presence and wants to make a good impression on you.

He might dress nicer, pay more attention to his grooming, and smell really good. He’s not necessarily doing it to get your attention but because he’s interested in you and wants to look his best. He wants you to find him attractive and desirable.

### **His Voice Gets Deeper When Talking With You** 

One peculiar biological phenomenon that occurs when a man is sexually attracted to a woman is a lower pitch of his voice when he talks to her compared to when he speaks to others. If you observe this change in the pitch of his voice, it’s a positive indication that he desires you intensely.

The rationale behind this phenomenon is that a deeper voice may unconsciously convey to a woman that he has the potential to produce healthy offspring.

### **He Rubs Your Shoulders**

![He Rubs Your Shoulders](images/screenshot_179-960x633-1.jpg "screenshot_179-960x633-1")

If someone massages your shoulders, it may be a way to help you relax or alleviate stress. However, if this person is a man, it could also be a sign that he’s interested in you sexually.

Pay attention to the context of the situation and your conversation with him to determine his intentions. If he only gives you a quick shoulder massage and seems to be focused on initiating sexual activity, then it’s likely that he just wants sex.

### **He Notices Every Little Detail Of You**

When a man feels attracted to a woman, he becomes extremely observant. He’ll notice even the slightest changes in your appearance, such as a new hairstyle or makeup. He’ll also be very complimentary, expressing his appreciation for your looks, whether you’ve changed them or not. He’s so enamored with you that if he were any more interested, he’d be stranded in the Sahara Desert.

By the way, would you like to discover a specific phrase you can say to him that will make him hang onto every word you utter?

## Final Thoughts

While there are many **signs that he wants you sexually**, it is important to remember that everyone expresses attraction differently. Communicating openly and honestly with your lover about your boundaries and desires is crucial. It is also essential to ensure that any sexual activity is consensual and safe. Pay attention to your own feelings and intuition, and believe in yourself to make the right decisions for your own well-being. Remember, while attraction is important in a relationship, it is just one aspect, and a healthy and fulfilling relationship involves more than just physical attraction.
