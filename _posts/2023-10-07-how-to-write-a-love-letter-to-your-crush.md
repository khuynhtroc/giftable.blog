The Purpose of a Love Letter

The love letter is quite popular to show off your love in the past. You can easily catch in old movies that couples give each other love letters to their sweeties. They don’t use words because of shyness when they meet each other. Hands and feet shaking and losing themselves, the anxiety of confessing makes letters become effective assistants replace for what they want to say. 

Why is handwriting more romantic than text? It’s unique, for sure. Text is designed to have a basic form, and it cannot show sincerity through short messages. Do you tend to text her/him that “I really love you, please be my lover”? It is extremely boring and has no feelings.
