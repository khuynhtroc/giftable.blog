How to become a bad guy helping attract good girls

As some aspects mentioned above, you can get a fundamental knowledge of the reason “why good girls like bad guys.” And now you are wondering how to be a bad guy. There are some essential tips you must learn first. 

### **Put Yourself First**

Many boys think girls want to find a prince, like in the love story, who is ready to sacrifice themselves to protect their lover. It’s probably right but in the movies. It can make them a joker, so don’t behave like you are the main character. It is an unnecessary disadvantage.

You must show how you love yourself first. Don’t try to chase a good girl at all. Concern about your career, your goal to attract her as a real man.  You can also leave her some hints to announce your heart that you also see her interested but not too clearly.

You don’t have any responsibility for her life, so don’t promise like “I’m always ready to do anything you want.” Instead, suggest to her that “my road is too alone, so I need someone to come in. May I invite you?” if you behave like she is the priority. She soon sees you as nothing because she believes you can’t live without her. Maintain your own relationship as well as interests. Let’s she understand that she is not the only one. You can also get happiness without her.

### **Speak Your Truth**

Many people will think that boy is often a liar because lies are bad behavior. But it is actually not. An authentic bad boy does not care about other thoughts, so he isn’t shy to confidently speak the truth. The truth is the main key factor to making her believe in you.

It is believed that women have the sixth sense, so they have the ability to realize their man lying. It doesn’t make sense for bad boys, but it is a terrible thing for good boys. You have to understand that a lie is sometimes more necessary than a truth. Who lets you know the truth is only sometimes the good one. 

No matter good or bad, as long as you can show her the truth, they will put absolute faith in you. Let her know who you are is the best option. She will adjust herself to be suitable for you. This advice will be an effective way to manipulate her mind.

### **Maintain Strong Boundaries**

Maintaining a certain boundary is necessary to make her stay within the limit. Stand by her and tell her about each other’s boundaries and consider whether the two of you can meet the same demand. It’s quite similar to “speak your truth” because personal affairs need to be respected. No one like another to be excessive enthusiasm to join in their private. Each individual has their own work, friends, goals, etc. Lovers need to share stories but not at all. 

On the other hand, if your partner manages too many things about you, they can manipulate you. Bad boys never let their baby girls know too many things about them. Keep something secret of making her curious. The love can be faded if we know the other in detail. 

### **Create a Container of Safety**

It doesn’t mean you have to show your strength through violence to attract her. It can be right in some circumstances, but violence has never ever been the best choice for a wise man. Instead, you can construct a secure container via leadership and dignity. 

![Create a Container of Safety](images/good-girls-like-bad-guys5.jpg "good-girls-like-bad-guys5")

Create a Container of Safety

For instance, a right gentleman doesn’t ask his girl, “what do you want to do next?”, He will give a list for her to choose from instead of requiring her to make a decision. “Do you want to go to the restaurant to have dinner?”, “Can I order you a spaghetti?” and “You prefer orange juice or apple, don’t you” are some samples more professional and elegant than the first one. 

You manage this relationship in this way. For a long putting pressure on her to select, you can lead her choices to create a sense of leadership. Good girls like bad guys because they find themselves being protected by their guys. They don’t have to decide between good men permanently, good men think that giving their beloved a chance to choose can impress her, but it doesn’t work. 

Therefore, the more you can show up as a leader and relieve her strain, the more attracted she will be. It is an important key to flirting with girls. 

### **Strive for Growth and Shun the Status Quo**

Girls like guys with a strong will to strive, so it is an indispensable part of men. Are you learning or working? No matter what it is, you must always try your best to improve your life. Modern girls don’t put their life in a stupid boy with no will to progress. It far which generation a cottage with two gold hearts, you are nothing if cannot take care her. 

You were a bad guy when each other met. However, now and future, if you are still bad, you give up on yourself. Therefore, don’t expect to have a girl besides loves you. It is a little similar to the safety principle that you need to show potential improvement to reassure her. 

Girls extremely love to listen to their goals and plans for the future, what they are going to do, where they will stay, what type of job they like, etc. Let’s show her to satisfy her curiosity and imply that you are a perfect man.
