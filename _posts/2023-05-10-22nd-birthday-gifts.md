description: "Old T Swift (RIP), on the other hand, sings to us about how feeling “22” is a wonderful sensation. It’s true; people are happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time, and it is indeed miserable and magical. Make someone’s 22nd birthday memorable by giving them a gift that will benefit them in the long run."
