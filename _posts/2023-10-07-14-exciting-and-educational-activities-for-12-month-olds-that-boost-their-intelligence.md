So your child has just turned one year old; let’s celebrate that together! This is a memorable milestone in a child’s life, marking not only the wonderful memories of the first few months but also a time for you to plan new activities that will aid in their overall physical and intellectual development.

I understand that you may be wondering if there are any new activities that your one-year-old should be engaging in compared to previous months. Is it ok for them to develop well with free play activities at home with parents, or do they need to attend daycare to enhance their social skills? What factors will help your child’s overall development, and what should you be aware of? These are valid questions that can make you feel overwhelmed, but don’t worry; we will address them in this article.

Overall, the main activities for a one-year-old child are quite similar to those of the earlier months, such as crawling, pulling up, and cruising. However, at this stage, we need to focus more on [developing your child’s intellectual abilities](https://avada.io/loveable/educational-toys-1-year-olds/) because this is a period when their brain is rapidly developing. Therefore, we need to incorporate new activities that can enhance their cognitive development. Below are 11 suitable **activities for 12-month-old** children to aid in their intellectual development. Let’s get started!

## 14 Best Activities for a 1-Year-Old That You Need to Know

### **1\. Storytime** 

![Activities for 12-Month-Olds](images/screenshot_490-960x608-1.jpg "screenshot_490-960x608-1")

Many people think a 12-month-old baby cannot understand what adults say, but the reality is different. A one-year-old baby can understand many simple words, phrases, and grammar. Toddlers often learn language by listening and observing the adults around them, so letting them hear as much as possible can give them more learning opportunities.

The best tip to do this is to set a specific time of day to tell stories to your baby. You should buy books with many colors and images or comics. Hold the baby’s finger when telling stories, and follow the words on the pages you read. By doing this, the child will develop a better sense of language. Remember to read with a gentle tone and many different intonations to stimulate the baby’s hearing.

### **2\. Outdoor Walk**

Taking young children for regular walks is a good idea to [help them develop their intellect](https://lovevery.com/community/blog/child-development/the-benefits-of-bringing-your-baby-outside/). This will give them the opportunity to observe a wide variety of objects and, of course, speed up their learning process.

When you see your child looking at something, point to it and say the name of the object, for example, “That’s a blue car” or “Look at the dog.” Taking the time to take your child for a walk outside every day (avoiding bad weather days to prevent illness, of course) also helps to strengthen their immune system, as the gentle morning sunlight helps with nutrient absorption.

### **3\. Obstacles Crawl**

![Activities for 12-Month-Olds](images/screenshot_438-2-960x620-1.jpg "screenshot_438-2-960x620-1")

Encouraging young children to crawl over small objects placed on the floor can help them develop good hand-eye coordination and fine motor skills. It can also promote cognitive development as they learn to problem-solve and navigate different situations.

A simple and effective way to do this is by taking apart the top and bottom of several boxes and then sticking them together to create a long tunnel. Additionally, using play tents and tunnels can also be a fun and engaging way to help children practice their motor skills and explore the world around them.

### **4\. Sensory Bottle** 

You can improve your child’s visual and sensory skills by putting small beads, such as glitter or rice, into an empty bottle with a tight-fitting lid. Then, give it to your baby and let them shake it to enhance their visual and sensory abilities. You can also create various types of bottles using different containers to increase stimulation.

### **5\. Play with Puzzle**

![Activities for 12-Month-Olds](images/screenshot_491-960x640-1.jpg "screenshot_491-960x640-1")

Try buying a simple [personalized puzzle](https://avada.io/loveable/personalized-puzzles/) set and help your child complete it. At this age, your child may still have difficulty fitting the puzzle pieces together independently, but playing with puzzles can still help improve spatial awareness and problem-solving skills. And don’t forget to praise them once they complete it.

### **6\. Play with Water**

This is such a fun activity that you can enjoy all year round! There are always ways to make it work, whether sunny or snowy outside. This activity will boost the child’s sense of the material. During the summer, you can play outdoors and splash around in a water park or fill up a water table or even a kiddie pool. And when it gets chilly in the winter, your little one can still have a blast playing in the sink or taking a bath.

### **7\. Drawing**  

Consider buying your child a simple box of crayons to do this activity. And when I say “draw” here, it doesn’t mean your child will be drawing the Mona Lisa. All your child will do is scribble colors on a piece of paper. You can also show them how to make marks and introduce different colors. This activity will stimulate their visual senses, and color will increase their creativity as they develop. Note that using crayons instead of paint is better to avoid getting messy.

### **8\. Magnet Play**

Playing with magnets is a fun activity that even I still enjoy even at the age of 10. The way magnets attract and repel is sure to fascinate children. Moreover, there are many games you can play with magnets that you can come up with. For example, you can place a magnet on one side of a paper and the other magnet on the other side, then slowly move the magnets around to make the child amused. 

There are also many fun and exciting games with magnets that you can find on Amazon.

### **9\. Pom Pom Drop**

This game is not only exciting, but it also costs you nothing! All you need to do is attach an empty paper tube to a wall with some tape to hold it in place. Grab some pom poms and let your baby practice their hand-eye coordination skills as they drop the pom pom through the hole. It’s so exciting to watch it come out through the bottom end! 

To start off, you can place the tube vertically. As your little one gets better at it, you can make it more challenging by changing up the angles.

### **10\. Block Stacking** 

![Block Stacking ](images/screenshot_493-960x624-1.jpg "screenshot_493-960x624-1")

Sorting blocks by color, order, and size can be a very fun activity for young children. It is a highly creative activity, and you can start introducing block sorting to your child from the first few months of their life. 

With a wide range of colors, textures, and shapes, this toy helps children develop their imagination and reasoning skills. Make sure to get a set of blocks for your child to enjoy this activity.

### **11\. Shaving cream mash-up**

Playing with shaving cream is a very fun activity, albeit a little messy. Spray some shaving cream onto a surface (preferably in the bathroom), then let your child play with it, squishing and even hitting it to make it splatter. This is a highly satisfying and sensory-stimulating activity for children, and shaving cream is relatively safe since it only involves hand movements. 

You can also add some edible food coloring to make the shaving cream more colorful and visually appealing. Of course, you should always supervise your child during playtime and make sure they don’t put the cream in their mouth or eyes.

### **12\. Edible Playdough**

Playing with play dough is already fun, but you can make it even safer and healthier with these tips. Mix cornstarch with a little bit of water, slowly pouring the water into the bowl of cornstarch and kneading the mixture continuously until you get a soft, pliable dough that feels just like regular play dough. 

Finally, you can divide the dough into smaller pieces and add different food coloring to each piece. These activities are fun and safe, without the harmful chemicals found in regular play dough products that can be harmful to children.

### **13\. Playing with Bubbles** 

![Playing with Bubbles ](images/screenshot_494-960x636-1.jpg "screenshot_494-960x636-1")

Engaging in bubble play can be a fantastic pastime both indoors and outdoors, but take heed to avoid unintentionally wafting bubbles into your little one’s face, for the solution can irritate their eyes. With their inexplicable characteristics, bubbles truly possess a touch of enchantment.

### **14\. Play with the Reflection** 

Infants love to play with mirrors. If you have a generously sized one in your abode, such as on a wardrobe door, introduce your little bundle of joy to it and demonstrate how to make silly faces, clap hands, and exchange high-fives with their reflection. It could also be entertaining to experiment with different accessories, like hats and scarves, in front of the mirror.
