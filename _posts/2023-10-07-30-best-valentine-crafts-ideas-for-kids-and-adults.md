Make a heart from a 10- to 12-inch piece of wire by wrapping it with red twine and setting it aside. Make a clay heart by baking modeling clay in the oven. Before baking, punch a hole in the top so it can be hung and write a phrase on it if you want, then set it aside. Three large, three medium, and three small heart-shaped cookie cutters need holes punched in the bend and point. Cut the twine into three pieces. Working with one length at a time, thread a large, medium, and small cookie cutter onto the twine. Tie a knot above and below each cutter to keep it in place. Do it again with the rest of the string and cookie cutters. Wrap lengths of twine around the wire heart, making sure the hearts are facing the right way. Gather the twine lengths at the top and tie a knot to hang. Knot lengths of twine at the bottom and cut. Thread a short piece of twine through the ceramic heart, tie a knot at the bottom of the wine chime, and hang.
