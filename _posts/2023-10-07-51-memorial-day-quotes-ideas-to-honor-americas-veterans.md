The origins of memorial day

The Civil War ravaged the country, killing around 620,000 troops. Prior to the establishment of the holiday, Americans would pay their respects to both Union and Confederate troops, lighting vigils and decorating their graves with flowers. 

Looking back at history, on May 5, 1868, the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR), an association of Union army veterans, founded Decoration Day as a chance to decorate the war dead’s graves with flowers. After that, the schedule of Decoration Day was transferred to May 30 because it’s the time beautiful flowers bloom strongly in the year.

Beginning in 1873, official recognition as a holiday extended throughout the states, beginning with New York. Every Union state had accepted it by 1890. “Decoration Day” was declared a federal holiday by Congress in 1938, and the term “Memorial Day” became increasingly popular following World War II. However, that name was not officially approved by the federal government until 1967. Finally, in 1971, Congress renamed the holiday “Memorial Day” and moved it to the final Monday in May.
