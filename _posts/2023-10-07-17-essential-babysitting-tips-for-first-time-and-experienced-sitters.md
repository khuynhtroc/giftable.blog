## 17 Essential Babysitting Tips for Baby Sitters

### 1\. Stick to The Family Schedule

![Babysitting Tips](images/screenshot_443-960x651-1.jpg "screenshot_443-960x651-1")

When you’re babysitting, you should always remember that each household has its own unique schedule and routines. This can include meal times, nap times, bedtime routines, and screen time limits. To ensure that you’re able to provide the best care possible, don’t be afraid to ask the parents to outline their typical schedule when you arrive at their home. This will help you understand what’s expected and ensure that the children are able to follow their usual routine.

If you’re babysitting for an extended period, it can be helpful to ask the parents to write down the schedule and any additional notes or instructions. In this way, you can refer to it throughout the day and avoid any confusion or disruptions to the routine. Maintaining the family schedule will help the children feel more comfortable and at ease with having a babysitter and ensure that their usual routine is followed.

### 2\. Be Prepared for Emergencies.

Prior to the departure of parents or guardians, you need to document any emergency numbers, allergies or medical conditions, and health card details. Additionally, it is also recommended to obtain the contact information of an emergency contact who can be reached in case the parents cannot be contacted. 

Make sure you know all the exits and find the fire extinguishers in the house. This will help you leave quickly if there is an emergency. These precautionary measures can help you remain composed and self-assured during an emergency.

### 3\. Observe and Enforce the Family Rules

![Babysitting Tips](images/screenshot_441-960x643-1.jpg "screenshot_441-960x643-1")

Each family has its own specific set of rules, and as a babysitter, it is your responsibility to enforce them. For instance, certain families may have restrictions on screen time or sugar consumption. As the person in charge, it is necessary to be aware of these rules and ensure that they are adhered to. Prior to the parents’ departure, it is recommended to ask relevant questions to clarify what to do in various situations, such as how to handle unexpected knocks on the door or phone calls.

### 4\. Be On Time 

As a babysitter, you’ll often be hired for specific events, like dinner reservations, movie outings, or work hours. Therefore, you always need to arrive on time. If you’re babysitting for a new family, you might want to consider arriving 15 minutes early so that you can ask anything about the child’s routine, schedule, and household rules. Punctuality indicates to the parents or caregivers that you’re dependable, which increases the likelihood of receiving repeat jobs or referrals to other families.

### 5\. Keep The Parents Updated

![Babysitting Tips](images/screenshot_440-960x594-1.jpg "screenshot_440-960x594-1")

Certain parents and guardians appreciate receiving regular updates from the babysitter. If requested, you can send messages throughout the babysitting duration or provide a summary report at the end of the session. In the case of younger children, the update may include details such as their food intake, nap duration, or the time they went to bed.

### 6\. Look Over The Rules For Health And Safety.

As a babysitting assignment, it is advisable to review any pertinent health and safety protocols, such as CPR or first aid training. As recommendations may vary depending on the age group or with the release of new information, revisiting the material can prove beneficial. This enables you to prepare for a secure experience and maintain composure if the child requires any first aid. In the case of a child with an allergy, it may also be necessary to revisit the appropriate medication administration techniques.

### 7\. Be Flexible

![Babysitting Tips](images/screenshot_438-960x620-1.jpg "screenshot_438-960x620-1")

Occasionally, children may not be interested in participating in planned activities, crafts, or games, depending on their mood or time of day. As a babysitter, you should remain adaptable and open to changes. Consider asking the children for input on what they might prefer to do instead. If permitted by the parents, try switching up the routine by taking a walk to the local park or going on a bike ride.

Being flexible also demonstrates your willingness to accommodate the parents’ requests, such as arriving earlier or staying later than expected. This approach highlights your reliability and empathy toward their needs. In such situations, remember to keep track of your hours and ensure you are appropriately compensated.

### 8\. Pack Necessary Supplies

Get ready for your babysitting appointment by packing a bag of essentials. Toss in some healthy snacks to munch on, art supplies to get creative with, and a book to escape into when the little ones are dreaming away. Remember, it’s better to be overly prepared than caught in a bind without the necessary supplies. Packing your bag, and get ready to have some fun!

### 9\. Eat Well and Drink Enough Water

![Babysitting Tips](images/screenshot_435-960x590-1.jpg "screenshot_435-960x590-1")

Fuel up and feel fabulous for your babysitting gig by choosing healthy, nutrient-rich foods to keep you energized throughout the day. Skipping meals or indulging in junk food will only leave you feeling depleted and unproductive. 

Remember, you’re being paid to care for the kiddos, not to snooze on the job. Boost your energy levels by filling up on wholesome foods, and you’ll have the stamina to keep up with the most energetic little kids. Don’t forget to stay hydrated, too, as dehydration can cause headaches, fatigue, and general grogginess. Keep your energy high and your focus sharp, and the kids (and parents) will appreciate you for it!

### 10\. Plan Your Return Home

To ensure your safe return home, make a plan in advance. If you don’t have your own transportation, ask a member of the family or someone to help you. Avoid walking or biking home alone at night unless you live close by. Always remember, your safety is your responsibility, so take control and plan ahead!

### 11\. Stay Cool

Stay cool all the time! When you maintain a good sense of calm and composure, the children around you will feel relaxed and more receptive to your care, resulting in harmonious relationships and a stress-free experience. Keeping your cool is key to impressing the parents and landing future gigs as a babysitter.

### 12\. Obtain Relevant Certifications 

![Babysitting Tips](images/screenshot_439-960x625-1.jpg "screenshot_439-960x625-1")

It is possible to land a babysitting job even without any certifications. However, obtaining certain certifications can boost your confidence and improve your ability to keep children safe. If you plan to work as a babysitter for an extended period, having these certifications can increase your chances of finding employment and even enable you to charge higher rates.

### 13\. Understand Your Comfort Level

Before agreeing to babysit, you need to understand your limitations and ask specific questions about the parents’ expectations and needs of a babysitter. This will assist you in determining if you’re the right fit for the family and if you can meet their needs.

Ask the parents how many children you will be watching and their ages; this will help you prepare accordingly. By asking these specific and careful questions, you can ensure that you’re fully prepared and capable of providing the best care for the kids.

### 14\. Communicate Well

When you’re looking after kids, don’t feel the pressure to solve everything on your own. Don’t hesitate to contact the parents if you encounter any difficulties or have any inquiries. It could be as easy as asking, “Where are the extra wipes?” or as complicated as saying, “Your son is really upset, and I don’t know how to calm him down. I’ve tried everything I can, but nothing seems to work well.”

Furthermore, if you have any worries, such as the child being bullied by a neighbor, make sure to notify the parents. Keep an open channel of communication; you are establishing a sense of trust with the parents. It demonstrates that you are committed to ensuring the safety and well-being of their child.

### 15\. Well-informed

Being prepared as a babysitter involves more than just knowing emergency numbers and checking for allergies. Some potential dangers may slip your mind when planning on your own. Ask experienced babysitters for guidance and consider taking a child care or babysitter training course to prepare for various babysitting situations. This will help you better handle any situation that may arise and ensure the safety and well-being of the children in your care.

### 16\. Try to Have Fun

![Babysitting Tips](images/screenshot_437.jpg "screenshot_437")

A good babysitter will engage the child in other activities. Start by learning the parent’s guidelines for playtime. Find out if the child can go to a nearby playground, which toys are their favorite, and which games and electronics are off-limits. With this information, you can plan out a variety of fun and interesting activities that will keep the child active and entertained.

Consider going outside and playing archaeologist, or staying indoors and playing pillow fort captain. And if the child you’re looking after has a disability, it’s important to know how to engage them in activities so they don’t feel excluded. Be sure to ask the parents about any specific accommodations or strategies that may be helpful in this regard.

### 17\. Be Open to Criticism

Sometimes parents may get upset or worried about something you do as a babysitter. When this happens, in these situations, you need to listen to their concerns and ask how you can do better in the future. Let them know you won’t do the same thing again. With this, you can build a good relationship with the parents and make them trust you more as a babysitter.
