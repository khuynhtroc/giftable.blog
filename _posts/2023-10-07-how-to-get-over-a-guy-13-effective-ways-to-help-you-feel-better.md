Do you ever get to a point when you just need to get over that certain guy but can’t seem to figure out how? You may have been in love with him for a while and have tried everything, from spending time apart to letting it all go. But what happens if none of those things worked for you and suddenly, the pain lingers on? 

Well then, now is the perfect time for you to try something new: discovering **how to get over a guy** you love once and for all! Read on as we explore helpful strategies that will help you through this incredibly difficult process.

## How to Get Over A Guy: 13 Best Ways You Can Do Easily 

### 1\. Give self-care more attention

![Give self-care more attention](images/how-to-get-over-a-guy-1.jpg "how-to-get-over-a-guy-1")

_Give self-care more attention_

Because you’ll be emotionally burned out, look after yourself. Now is the ideal moment to give your entire attention to you and make sure your wants are being satisfied.

Focus on your own growth and self-esteem because those things might suffer from time to time, whether through physical activity, a pastime, something you truly enjoy doing, or learning. As a result, you feel like you’re rediscovering your best self and confidence.

### 2\. Step it up in your upcoming relationship

Find out why your relationship didn’t work, and make sure the next person you date doesn’t possess that trait. You’ll realize there’s a reason you broke up with the guy, and once you understand you’re just not going to put up with it moving ahead, you’ll make your choice keeping that in mind. Then you won’t have to cope with that in the following relationship.

### 3\. If communication is getting in your way, stop doing it

How to get over a guy who ghosted you goes hand in hand with your interaction with him on social media. In the long term, it will be far more difficult to get over someone if you keep in touch with them or hook up with them, especially if you’re secretly hoping for a change of heart.

It’s probably not going to happen if you wait around for six months expecting the other person will change their mind and come back. And it’s not healthy since you’re not present. It doesn’t deal with what actually is, reality.

### 4\. Recognize your worth

A [breakup](https://avada.io/loveable/heal-from-a-breakup/) doesn’t make you unlovable or unpleasant, so keep that in mind. Internalizing false self-perceptions can be harmful. Instead, concentrate on your strongest traits. For instance, list 25 qualities that would make you a desirable catch. Before you start dating again, you can review it.

### 5\. Assemble the ladies

![Assemble the ladies](images/how-to-get-over-a-guy-2.jpg "how-to-get-over-a-guy-2")

_Assemble the ladies_

Blowing it off and going out with the girls is another fantastic approach to get over a guy who played you. Even when you are dealing with a lost love you never had, your friends remain your pillar of support. Let them take care of you and do their jobs.

Let them buy you a drink, compliment you, and tell you that it’s “his loss” if he chooses not to be with a rock star like you!

Call the ladies and have fun with your buddies, please. You’ll start feeling better very soon.

### 6\. Make your next move based on this unfortunate turn of events

![Make your next move based on this unfortunate turn of events](images/how-to-get-over-a-guy-3.jpg "how-to-get-over-a-guy-3")

Make your next move based on this unfortunate turn of events

Numerous Hollywood films have a female who meets a boy, finds out the boy has something or someone, or is going somewhere, and then things seem terrible. Even though they always overcome, this isn’t how real life works.

Instead of sitting around waiting for things to come together, go on a [road trip](https://avada.io/loveable/road-trips-gifts/), fly somewhere warm, and spend a few days at the beach. You don’t need anybody else, so give yourself the gift of yourself.

### 7\. Find things about him that you detest

It will be difficult, but you might be able to get past his good looks and find something so wrong with him that you don’t want to be with him. For example, he was impolite with waiters when you ate out together. Find a way to turn off, even if you have to create something in your imagination.

### 8\. Don’t act on your emotions since you don’t want to embarrass yourself or him

When you are trying to find ways to get over a guy who doesn’t like you, don’t put yourself feel compelled to meet him in a dimly lit pub or confess your love to him. What seems proper at the time might result in a lot of shame and sadness for all those concerned.

You need to consider what he would think of you as a result of your actions and if you want to be the cause of the breakup of his other relationship.

### 9\. Don’t check his social media page every day

![Don't check his social media page every day](images/how-to-get-over-a-guy-4.jpg "how-to-get-over-a-guy-4")

_Don’t check his social media page every day_

Quit following him. It’s unhealthy, and you may spend your time refreshing his Instagram profile instead of doing anything more fun.

You should try to avoid the man as much as possible to hasten your healing. However, you should take the necessary steps to make yourself feel better. You don’t have to avoid the guy at all costs, and it might not be possible to cut him out of your life completely.

If you tend to move in similar circles, this can include visiting new locations or hanging out with new acquaintances.

### 10\. Stop imagining potential outcomes

Stopping yourself from obsessing about what you may have done differently is among the most difficult things to practice. Whether you think that happened or not, it happened just as it was intended to, and there is no way to go back in time and change what happened.

It could be simpler to let go if you acknowledge that and realize that all you are doing is preventing yourself from going on. And it’s simple to dive into false drama when you spend all day and night feeling disappointed since your relationship ended.

Focus on what is happening right now and, for some comfort, direct your eyes and mind to the future rather than to what may have been. Even though you may have blown this connection, you may still grow from it and go on more positively.

### 11\. Never blame yourself

![Never blame yourself](images/how-to-get-over-a-guy-5.jpg "how-to-get-over-a-guy-5")

Never blame yourself

How to get over a guy who used you might start by stopping blaming yourself. Otherwise, you’ll simply feel worse as a result. Although it might be simple to glance in the mirror and find fault, try to remember that there is nothing particularly wrong with you. It just indicates that you two weren’t a good fit if the person you’re having difficulties getting over didn’t care about you.

Affirmations are a useful tool to assist you in keeping in mind that you are not at fault. You can remark, “I am deserving of love,” or “This was not my fault.”

### 12\. Make a list of good things about you and review it from time to time

Keep in mind how wonderful you are by yourself. Write out 10 qualities about yourself, no matter how insane, and sit back and read them. Anything might qualify as merit, including sobriety, fashion sense, friendliness, and generosity toward others. When you’re feeling down, refer to the list to help you get back up.

This activity is meant to help you keep in mind what a catch you are because experiencing rejection might diminish your self-esteem.

Sometimes it might be beneficial to get advice from a trusted friend as it’s normally difficult for us to see the good things in ourselves.

### 13\. Remove old pictures that trigger memories

![Remove old pictures that trigger memories](images/how-to-get-over-a-guy-6.jpg "how-to-get-over-a-guy-6")

_Remove old pictures that trigger memories_

Although it may be tough, moving on may be the best option. Of course, getting rid of everything is unnecessary as some memories might be nice to look back on when things go over. 

However, it might be time to clean up your camera roll if it is overflowing with images of the two of you. If you decide not to delete them, think about storing them on a USB drive and keeping them in a drawer.

The same holds true for any images of him displayed throughout your house. If you don’t want to entirely get rid of them, gather them all together and store them in a box or a closet drawer.

## How long does it take to go over a guy? 

Most people begin to accustom to living without their ex-partner after six weeks. After that, it might be considerably faster, but it usually isn’t.

Everyone experiences heartbreak differently, but it’s also a very frequent occurrence; finding support through networks like Mend that let you understand you’re not alone can be immensely empowering. According to Mend’s internal statistics, the app, which was born out of a newsletter and community for science-based heartbreak material, has assisted active Menders in beginning to feel better 58 percent sooner.

If all else fails and you continue to feel stuck after several months, it might be time to consider treatment. A breakup may occasionally truly knock you for a loop in a way that goes beyond what a buddy can handle. 

Therapy may provide a secure environment where you can express your feelings, discuss your anxieties, address any issues from the past that the breakup brings up, and prepare your heart and mind for dating again.

## Final thoughts,

Heartbreak can be a difficult thing to manage. It’s okay if it takes time **to get over a guy** and completely recover and your emotions won’t always make sense. Despite the rollercoaster of feelings, you’re not alone in this journey. It might help to talk with professionals or trusted mentors who understand your situation and offer advice. 

Lean heavily on those friends and family members who are already there for you, ever-ready, to lend an ear and a shoulder of comfort when needed. Taking time for yourself is crucial – make sure you have moments of peace where you don’t have to rush through each day emotionally weighed down. Above all, remember it is possible to heal from heartbreak, even if it requires being gentle with yourself until then.
