Create eye-catching paper ornaments for your tree with these delightful holiday-themed pinwheel shapes. Crafting them is a breeze and only requires a handful of cuts and folds.

Begin by grabbing some two-sided scrapbook paper. Transform the sheet into a square by trimming it accordingly. Now, with the square in hand, perform a diagonal cut from every corner, halting at the midpoint. Gently fold one side of each section towards the center (feel free to use tape or an extra hand to keep the first folds steady while you tackle the rest). Once folded, bring all four pieces together at the center and fasten them using a brad. Your tree will be adorned with these captivating pinwheels in no time!

### **15\. 3D Star Ornament**

![3D Star Ornament](images/3d-star-ornament.jpg "3d-star-ornament")

1. Get a [printable pattern](https://www.bhg.com/content/dam/bhg/PDFs/secure/SnowflakeStarOrnament.pdf) and download it.
2. Stick the pattern to a light box or a window with direct sunlight.
3. Place tracing paper on top of the pattern and secure it with tape.
4. Use a pencil to trace the pattern onto white cardstock.
5. Put pinholes on all the important points. This will help you get things right when you start and finish each cut.
6. Begin cutting from the center of the design and work your way outwards. Be careful not to cut the parts that hold the shape together.
7. Cut along all the lines in the pattern.
8. Start with the center star and gently twist it a quarter-turn.
9. Do the same twisting for each star, one after the other, until they’re all twisted out.

So, even though it might look complicated, you’ll create this cool snowflake using just one piece of paper. Just follow these steps and enjoy your crafty masterpiece!

### **16\. Bright Paper Christmas Ornament**
