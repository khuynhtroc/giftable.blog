## **6-Steps to Make Perfect Pretzels** 

![Halloween Pretzels](images/screenshot_21-6.jpg "screenshot_21-6")

Before we step into the Pretzel Spooky theme for Halloween, we need to know the standard recipe to make the perfect simple pretzels.

### **Ingredients**

- 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 2 ¼ teaspoons active dry yeast
- 1 cup warm water (around 110°F/43°C)
- 2 tablespoons baking soda
- Coarse salt (for sprinkling)
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted

### **11-Steps Instructions**

- **Step 1**: In a large mixing bowl, combine the warm water and sugar. Sprinkle the yeast over the water and let it sit for about 5 minutes until the yeast becomes foamy.

- **Step 2**: In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour and salt. Gradually add the flour mixture to the yeast mixture, stirring with a wooden spoon until a dough forms.

- **Step 3**: Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead for about 5-7 minutes until the dough becomes smooth and elastic. If the dough is too sticky, add a little more flour, but be careful not to add too much.

- **Step 4**: Shape the dough into a ball and place it in a greased bowl. Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel and let the dough rise in a warm place for about 1 hour or until it doubles in size.

- **Step 5**: Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or lightly grease it.

- **Step 6**: Punch down the risen dough to remove any air bubbles. Divide the dough into smaller portions, depending on how large you want your pretzels. Roll each portion into a long rope, about 20-22 inches in length.

- **Step 7**: To shape the pretzels, form each rope into a U-shape. Cross the ends of the U over each other twice, then fold the twisted portion down to the bottom of the U, forming the classic pretzel shape. Press the ends lightly to secure.

- **Step 8**: In a large pot, bring water to a boil. Add the baking soda (be careful, it will bubble up) and reduce the heat to a simmer. Gently place each pretzel into the simmering water for about 30 seconds, then remove using a slotted spoon and place them on the prepared baking sheet.

- **Step 9**: Sprinkle the pretzels with coarse salt, then bake in the preheated oven for about 12-15 minutes or until they turn golden brown.

- **Step 10**: Remove the pretzels from the oven and brush them with melted butter while they are still hot. This will give them a nice shine.

- **Step 11**: Allow the pretzels to cool slightly before serving. They are best enjoyed fresh and warm.

## **Spooky Theme Haloween Pretzel** 

### **Ghost Halloween Pretzel** 

![Halloween Pretzels](images/screenshot_22-5.jpg "screenshot_22-5")

**You will need the following:** 

- ½ teaspoon of coconut oil
- Edible eye candies
- A bag of mini pretzels
- A bag of pretzel rods
- 2 packs of white candy melt

**Melts the Chocolate in the microwave** 

- Place the white chocolate and ½ teaspoon of coconut oil in a microwave-safe bowl.
- Set the microwave to 50% power to avoid overheating the chocolate.
- Heat the chocolate in 30-second intervals, pausing to stir well after each interval.
- If the chocolate is not fully melted, return the bowl to the microwave and continue heating for 20 seconds more.
- Repeat the process until approximately 90% of the chocolate is melted, stirring in between.
- Remove the bowl from the microwave and whisk the mixture thoroughly. The residual heat in the bowl will help melt any remaining chocolate.

It’s important to note that [chocolate food](https://avada.io/loveable/chocolate-day-gifts/) can sometimes appear unmelted, leading to the mistake of reheating it unnecessarily. This can cause the chocolate to burn and harden at the bottom. Remember to stir every 20 to 30 seconds to ensure even melting. When melting a small quantity of chocolate, start with shorter intervals, such as 10 seconds, and continue stirring frequently. Keep in mind that microwave settings may vary, so adjust the timing according to your microwave’s power.

**Create Ghost Halloween pretzels** 

![Halloween Pretzels](images/screenshot_23-5.jpg "screenshot_23-5")

- Simply dip mini pretzels into melted white chocolate using a fork, making sure they are fully coated. Shake off any extra chocolate and place the pretzels on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. 
- Repeat this process until all the mini pretzels in the bag are coated. In no time, you’ll have a delightful batch of Ghost Halloween pretzels ready to savor. (If the melted chocolate for pretzel coating hardens while you’re working, simply return the bowl to the microwave for 10 to 20 seconds to reheat it lightly. Afterward, give it a good stir before using it again. This will help loosen the chocolate and make it easier to work with.)
- Allow the dipped pretzels to set. If desired, drizzle additional chocolate over the set of pretzels. Next, promptly press eye candies onto the pretzels. Let them set completely until the chocolate is firm.

### **Mummy Halloween Rod**

![Halloween Pretzels](images/screenshot_24-5.jpg "screenshot_24-5")

- Pour melted chocolate into a tall glass that suits the length of your pretzel rods.
- Dip each pretzel rod into the chocolate, one at a time, and place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
- Let the chocolate set on the pretzels, then drizzle additional chocolate over them. Add one medium-sized eye candy or two mini eye candies.
- Allow the pretzels to set completely. Once the chocolate is firm, you can wrap them in mini pretzel bags, tie them up with [Halloween ribbons](https://avada.io/loveable/halloween-ribbon/), and they’re ready for individual gifting.

### **Frankenstein Pretzels**

![Halloween Pretzels](images/screenshot_25-5.jpg "screenshot_25-5")

- Follow the instructions on the package to melt the green wafers. Dip the pretzels about ¾ of the way into the melted green wafers.
- Shake off any excess coating and then add black jimmies to create the hair and attach candy eyes.
- Allow the chocolate to set and harden before moving on to the next step.
- Once the chocolate is set, use black icing to decorate the mouth.

That’s it! Now you have fun and spooky pretzels ready to enjoy.

### **Monster Sprinkles Pretzel Rods**

![Halloween Pretzels](images/screenshot_26-2.jpg "screenshot_26-2")

Simply dip the pretzels into melted chocolate, ensuring they are fully coated. Then, add candy eyes and Halloween sprinkles to decorate them. Enjoy your deliciously festive treats!

### **Green Witch Finger Pretzel Rods**

![Halloween Pretzels](images/screenshot_27-2.jpg "screenshot_27-2")

Begin by dipping the pretzel into green candy melts, making sure it is completely covered. Then, carefully place a slivered almond on the top end of the pretzel to resemble a fingernail. If desired, you can optionally paint the almond with red or black icing to create the illusion of nail polish. Get creative and enjoy your spooky and delicious Halloween snack!

## **Extra Tips to Make Spooky Halloween Pretzel** 

![Halloween Pretzels](images/screenshot_28-2.jpg "screenshot_28-2")

### **Experiment with different colored candy melts** 

Don’t limit yourself to just one color. Try using various colored candy melts to create a vibrant and eye-catching assortment of pretzels.

### **Use food coloring** 

If you can’t find candy melts in the desired color, you can add a few drops of food coloring to white chocolate or white candy melts to achieve the desired spooky hues.

### **Get creative with decorations** 

Besides candy eyes and sprinkles, consider using other [Halloween-themed decorations](https://avada.io/loveable/cool-halloween-decorations/) such as edible glitter, miniature bats, spiders, or even tiny skeleton-shaped candies to enhance the spooky factor.

### **Add flavor**

Infuse your melted chocolate or candy melts with a touch of flavor by adding a few drops of extract, such as vanilla or almond, to give your pretzels an extra delicious twist.

### **Try different pretzel shapes** 

While mini pretzels are commonly used, feel free to experiment with different pretzel shapes, such as twists or rods, to add variety and visual interest to your Halloween treats.

Remember to let your imagination run wild and have fun while creating your spooky Halloween pretzels. Happy decorating!

### **Q: Can I use regular chocolate instead of candy melts for Halloween pretzels?**

A: Absolutely! If you or someone you’re preparing the Halloween pretzels for requires a gluten-free diet, you can use gluten-free pretzels as a substitute. Just ensure that all the other ingredients and decorations you use are also gluten-free.
