The struggle is real.
---------------------

Finding great gifts for your family and friends year after year is **_tough_**. It can take hours of scrolling and googling to find the perfect thing to delight the ones you love. [Giftable](/) makes it easier.

It’s all in the process.
------------------------

Giftlab is a **_data-driven company that_** prides itself on our lists. We are constantly updating our existing gift guides and running reports to make sure the best most clicked items make their way to the top of our lists – saving you time.

We keep our links are up to date, so you you’re not disappointed when you click links that are broken, outdated, or out of stock. We built Lasso to do this for us.

We have great taste.
--------------------

The giftlb team is made up of thoughtful gift givers and product junkies. The team spends their days scouring the internet for cool new and unique products. We research, test, and gift these items to make sure they will put a smile on someone’s face. Our team is creating new gift guides all the time so you can be sure yiu’ll find fresh ideas here.

We run on affilate income (and caffeine)
----------------------------------------

We believe transparency is key to earning and maintaining your trust, so we want you to understand how we make money without a ton of legal jargon.

When you click on a gift idea from one of our lists and make a purchase, sometimes the company you purchased from pays us a commission. It does not change the price you pay.

By being a member of the Amazon Associates program, we earn money from qualifying purchases you make that we refer. Since most things we buy are on Amazon anyway, it works out quite well.

We also have a relationship with Uncommon Goods since they also have some great gift options.

Everything was built and monetized by Lasso.

Do your affiliate commissions make you biased?
----------------------------------------------

We don’t think so. Amazon is the world’s most popular shopping search engine, so we often start there.

Some items on our lists earn us money, and some don’t. We don’t keep track because that’s not the goal. The goal is to make amazing gift lists. You’ll find plenty of gifts from other sites because they’re just too good not to include.
